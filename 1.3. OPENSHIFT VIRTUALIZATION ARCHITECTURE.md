## 1.3. OPENSHIFT VIRTUALIZATION ARCHITECTURE

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) deploys operator pods for each component of OpenShift Virtualization:

- Compute: virt-operator
- Storage: cdi-operator
- Network: cluster-network-addons-operator
- Scaling: ssp-operator

OLM also deploys the hyperconverged-cluster-operator pod, which is responsible for the deployment, configuration, and life cycle of other components, and several helper pods: hco-webhook , and hyperconverged-cluster-cli-download .

After all operator pods are successfully deployed, you should create the HyperConverged custom resource (CR). The configurations set in the HyperConverged CR serve as the single source of truth and the entrypoint for OpenShift Virtualization, and guide the behavior of the CRs.

The HyperConverged CR creates corresponding CRs for the operators of all other components within its reconciliation loop. Each operator then creates resources such as daemon sets, config maps, and additional components for the OpenShift Virtualization control plane. For example, when the HyperConverged Operator (HCO) creates the KubeVirt CR, the OpenShift Virtualization Operator reconciles it and creates additional resources such as virt-controller , virt-handler , and virt-api .

The OLM deploys the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator, but it is not functional until you create a hostpath-provisioner CR.
