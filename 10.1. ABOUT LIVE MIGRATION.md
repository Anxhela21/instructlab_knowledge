## 10.1. ABOUT LIVE MIGRATION

Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine (VM) to another node in the cluster without interrupting the virtual workload. Live migration enables smooth transitions during cluster upgrades or any time a node needs to be drained for maintenance or configuration changes.

By default, live migration traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
