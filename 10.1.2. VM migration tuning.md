## 10.1.2. VM migration tuning

You can adjust your cluster-wide live migration settings based on the type of workload and migration scenario. This enables you to control how many VMs migrate at the same time, the network bandwidth you want to use for each migration, and how long OpenShift Virtualization attempts to complete the migration before canceling the process. Configure these settings in the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

If you are migrating multiple VMs per node at the same time, set a bandwidthPerMigration limit to prevent a large or busy VM from using a large portion of the node's network bandwidth. By default, the bandwidthPerMigration value is 0 , which means unlimited.

A large VM running a heavy workload (for example, database processing), with higher memory dirty rates, requires a higher bandwidth to complete the migration.
