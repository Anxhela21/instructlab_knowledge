## 10.2.2. Configure live migration for heavy workloads

When migrating a VM running a heavy workload (for example, database processing) with higher memory dirty rates, you need a higher bandwidth to complete the migration.

If the dirty rate is too high, the migration from one node to another does not converge. To prevent this, enable post copy mode.

Post copy mode triggers if the initial pre-copy phase does not complete within the defined timeout. During post copy, the VM CPUs pause on the source host while transferring the minimum required memory pages. Then the VM CPUs activate on the destination host, and the remaining memory pages transfer into the destination node at runtime.

Configure live migration for heavy workloads by updating the HyperConverged custom resource (CR), which is located in the openshift-cnv namespace.
