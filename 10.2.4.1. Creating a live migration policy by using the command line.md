## 10.2.4.1. Creating a live migration policy by using the command line

You can create a live migration policy by using the command line. KubeVirt applies the live migration policy to selected virtual machines (VMs) by using any combination of labels:

- VM labels such as size , os , or gpu
- Project labels such as priority , bandwidth , or hpc-workload

For the policy to apply to a specific group of VMs, all labels on the group of VMs must match the labels of the policy.
