## 10.3. Enabling dedicated resources for virtual machine templates




Virtual machines can have resources of a node, such as CPU, dedicated to them to improve performance.

### 10.3.1. About dedicated resources




When you enable dedicated resources for your virtual machine, your virtual machine’s workload is scheduled on CPUs that will not be used by other processes. By using dedicated resources, you can improve the performance of the virtual machine and the accuracy of latency predictions.

### 10.3.2. Prerequisites




- The [CPU Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/scalability_and_performance/#using-cpu-manager-and-topology-manager) must be configured on the node. Verify that the node has the `    cpumanager` = `    true` label before scheduling virtual machine workloads.


### 10.3.3. Enabling dedicated resources for a virtual machine template




You enable dedicated resources for a virtual machine template in the **Details** tab. Virtual machines that were created from a Red Hat template can be configured with dedicated resources.

 **Procedure** 

1. In the OpenShift Container Platform console, click **Virtualization** → **Templates** from the side menu.
1. Select a virtual machine template to open the **Template details** page.
1. On the **Scheduling** tab, click the pencil icon beside **Dedicated Resources** .
1. Select **Schedule this workload with dedicated resources (guaranteed policy)** .
1. Click **Save** .
