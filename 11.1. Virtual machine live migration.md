## 11.1. Virtual machine live migration




### 11.1.1. About live migration




Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine instance (VMI) to another node in the cluster without interrupting the virtual workload or access. If a VMI uses the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy, it automatically migrates when the node that the VMI runs on is placed into maintenance mode. You can also manually start live migration by selecting a VMI to migrate.

You can use live migration if the following conditions are met:

- Shared storage with `    ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode.
- Sufficient RAM and network bandwidth.
- If the virtual machine uses a host model CPU, the nodes must support the virtual machine’s host model CPU.


By default, live migration traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
