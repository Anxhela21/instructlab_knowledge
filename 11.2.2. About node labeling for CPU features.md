## 11.2.2. About node labeling for CPU features

Through the process of iteration, the base CPU features in the minimum CPU model are eliminated from the list of labels generated for the node.

For example:

- An environment might have two supported CPU models: Penryn and Haswell .
- If Penryn is specified as the CPU model for minCPU , each base CPU feature for Penryn is compared to the list of CPU features supported by Haswell .
