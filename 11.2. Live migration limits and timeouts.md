## 11.2. Live migration limits and timeouts




Apply live migration limits and timeouts so that migration processes do not overwhelm the cluster. Configure these settings by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

### 11.2.1. Configuring live migration limits and timeouts




Configure live migration limits and timeouts for the cluster by updating the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR), which is located in the `openshift-cnv` namespace.

 **Procedure** 

- Edit the `    HyperConverged` CR and add the necessary live migration parameters.
    
    
    ```
    $ oc edit hco -n openshift-cnv kubevirt-hyperconverged
    ```
    
     **Example configuration file** 
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1    kind: HyperConverged    metadata:      name: kubevirt-hyperconverged      namespace: openshift-cnv    spec:      liveMigrationConfig:<span id="CO111-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>bandwidthPerMigration: 64Mi        completionTimeoutPerGiB: 800        parallelMigrationsPerCluster: 5        parallelOutboundMigrationsPerNode: 2        progressTimeout: 150
    ```
    
    
    Note
    You can restore the default value for any `    spec.liveMigrationConfig` field by deleting that key/value pair and saving the file. For example, delete `    progressTimeout: &lt;value&gt;` to restore the default `    progressTimeout: 150` .

 **Table 11.1. Migration parameters** 

| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  `parallelMigrationsPerCluster` | Number of migrations running in parallel in the cluster. | 5 |
|  `parallelOutboundMigrationsPerNode` | Maximum number of outbound migrations per node. | 2 |
|  `bandwidthPerMigration` | Bandwidth limit of each migration, where the value is the quantity of bytes per second. For example, a value of `2048Mi` means 2048 MiB/s. | 0 |
|  `completionTimeoutPerGiB` | The migration is canceled if it has not completed in this time, in seconds per GiB of memory. For example, a virtual machine instance with 6GiB memory times out if it has not completed migration in 4800 seconds. If the `Migration Method` is `BlockMigration` , the size of the migrating disks is included in the calculation. | 800 |
|  `progressTimeout` | The migration is canceled if memory copy fails to make progress in this time, in seconds. | 150 |




1. The default value of `    0` is unlimited.
