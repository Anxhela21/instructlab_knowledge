## 11.8. Configuring live migration policies




You can define different migration configurations for specified groups of virtual machine instances (VMIs) by using a live migration policy.

Important
Live migration policy is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see [Technology Preview Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/) .



### 11.8.1. Configuring a live migration policy




Use the `MigrationPolicy` custom resource definition (CRD) to define migration policies for one or more groups of selected virtual machine instances (VMIs).

You can specify groups of VMIs by using any combination of the following:

- Virtual machine instance labels such as `    size` , `    os` , `    gpu` , and other VMI labels.
- Namespace labels such as `    priority` , `    bandwidth` , `    hpc-workload` , and other namespace labels.


For the policy to apply to a specific group of VMIs, all labels on the group of VMIs must match the labels in the policy.

Note
If multiple live migration policies apply to a VMI, the policy with the highest number of matching labels takes precedence. If multiple policies meet this criteria, the policies are sorted by lexicographic order of the matching labels keys, and the first one in that order takes precedence.



 **Procedure** 

1. Create a `    MigrationPolicy` CRD for your specified group of VMIs. The following example YAML configures a group with the labels `    hpc-workloads:true` , `    xyz-workloads-type: ""` , `    workload-type: db` , and `    operating-system: ""` :
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: migrations.kubevirt.io/v1alpha1    kind: MigrationPolicy    metadata:      name: my-awesome-policy    spec:      # Migration Configuration      allowAutoConverge: true      bandwidthPerMigration: 217Ki      completionTimeoutPerGiB: 23      allowPostCopy: false          # Matching to VMIs      selectors:        namespaceSelector:<span id="CO114-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>matchLabels:            hpc-workloads: "True"            xyz-workloads-type: ""        virtualMachineInstanceSelector:<span id="CO114-2"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">2</span>matchLabels:            workload-type: "db"            operating-system: ""
    ```
