## 12.1. About node maintenance




### 12.1.1. About node maintenance mode




Nodes can be placed into maintenance mode using the `oc adm` utility, or using `NodeMaintenance` custom resources (CRs).

Note
The `node-maintenance-operator` (NMO) is no longer shipped with OpenShift Virtualization. It is now available to deploy as a standalone Operator from the **OperatorHub** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, or by using the OpenShift CLI ( `oc` ).



Placing a node into maintenance marks the node as unschedulable and drains all the virtual machines and pods from it. Virtual machine instances that have a `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy are live migrated to another node without loss of service. This eviction strategy is configured by default in virtual machine created from common templates but must be configured manually for custom virtual machines.

Virtual machine instances without an eviction strategy are shut down. Virtual machines with a `RunStrategy` of `Running` or `RerunOnFailure` are recreated on another node. Virtual machines with a `RunStrategy` of `Manual` are not automatically restarted.

Important
Virtual machines must have a persistent volume claim (PVC) with a shared `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode to be live migrated.



The Node Maintenance Operator watches for new or deleted `NodeMaintenance` CRs. When a new `NodeMaintenance` CR is detected, no new workloads are scheduled and the node is cordoned off from the rest of the cluster. All pods that can be evicted are evicted from the node. When a `NodeMaintenance` CR is deleted, the node that is referenced in the CR is made available for new workloads.

Note
Using a `NodeMaintenance` CR for node maintenance tasks achieves the same results as the `oc adm cordon` and `oc adm drain` commands using standard OpenShift Container Platform custom resource processing.



### 12.1.2. Maintaining bare metal nodes




When you deploy OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal infrastructure, there are additional considerations that must be taken into account compared to deploying on cloud infrastructure. Unlike in cloud environments where the cluster nodes are considered ephemeral, re-provisioning a bare metal node requires significantly more time and effort for maintenance tasks.

When a bare metal node fails, for example, if a fatal kernel error happens or a NIC card hardware failure occurs, workloads on the failed node need to be restarted elsewhere else on the cluster while the problem node is repaired or replaced. Node maintenance mode allows cluster administrators to gracefully power down nodes, moving workloads to other parts of the cluster and ensuring workloads do not get interrupted. Detailed progress and node status details are provided during maintenance.
