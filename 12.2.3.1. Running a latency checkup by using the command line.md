You use a predefined checkup to verify network connectivity and measure latency between two virtual machines (VMs) that are attached to a secondary network interface. The latency checkup uses the ping utility.

You run a latency checkup by performing the following steps:

- 1. Create a service account, roles, and rolebindings to provide cluster access permissions to the latency checkup.
- 2.  Create a config map to provide the input to run the checkup and to store the results.
- 3.  Create a job to run the checkup.
- 4.  Review the results in the config map.
- 5.  Optional: To rerun the checkup, delete the existing config map and job and then create a new config map and job.
- 6.  When you are finished, delete the latency checkup resources.
