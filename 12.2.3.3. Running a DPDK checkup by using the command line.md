## 12.2.3.3. Running a DPDK checkup by using the command line

Use a predefined checkup to verify that your OpenShift Container Platform cluster node can run a virtual machine (VM) with a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workload with zero packet loss. The DPDK checkup runs traffic between a traffic generator and a VM running a test DPDK application.

You run a DPDK checkup by performing the following steps:

- 1. Create a service account, role, and role bindings for the DPDK checkup.
- 2.  Create a config map to provide the input to run the checkup and to store the results.
- 3.  Create a job to run the checkup.
- 4.  Review the results in the config map.
- 5.  Optional: To rerun the checkup, delete the existing config map and job and then create a new config map and job.
- 6.  When you are finished, delete the DPDK checkup resources.
