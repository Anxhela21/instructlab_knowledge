## 12.2.3.3.2. Building a container disk image for RHEL virtual machines

You can build a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 OS image in qcow2 format and use it to create a container disk image. You can store the container disk image in a registry that is accessible from your cluster and specify the image location in the spec.param.vmContainerDiskImage attribute of the DPDK checkup config map.

To build a container disk image, you must create an image builder virtual machine (VM). The image builder VM is a RHEL 9 VM that can be used to build custom RHEL images.
