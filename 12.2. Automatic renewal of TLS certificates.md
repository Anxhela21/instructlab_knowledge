## 12.2. Automatic renewal of TLS certificates




All TLS certificates for OpenShift Virtualization components are renewed and rotated automatically. You are not required to refresh them manually.

### 12.2.1. TLS certificates automatic renewal schedules




TLS certificates are automatically deleted and replaced according to the following schedule:

- KubeVirt certificates are renewed daily.
- Containerized Data Importer controller (CDI) certificates are renewed every 15 days.
- MAC pool certificates are renewed every year.


Automatic TLS certificate rotation does not disrupt any operations. For example, the following operations continue to function without any disruption:

- Migrations
- Image uploads
- VNC and console connections
