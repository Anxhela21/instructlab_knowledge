## 12.3.2. Querying metrics

The OpenShift Container Platform monitoring dashboard enables you to run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

As a cluster administrator, you can query metrics for all core OpenShift Container Platform and userdefined projects.

As a developer, you must specify a project name when querying metrics. You must have the required privileges to view metrics for the selected project.
