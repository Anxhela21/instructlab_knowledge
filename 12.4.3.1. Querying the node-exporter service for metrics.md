## 12.4.3.1. Querying the node-exporter service for metrics

Metrics are exposed for virtual machines through an HTTP service endpoint under the /metrics canonical name. When you query for metrics, Prometheus directly scrapes the metrics from the metrics endpoint exposed by the virtual machines and presents these metrics for viewing.
