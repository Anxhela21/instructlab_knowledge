## 12.6.1. About readiness and liveness probes

Use readiness and liveness probes to detect and handle unhealthy virtual machines (VMs). You can include one or more probes in the specification of the VM to ensure that traffic does not reach a VM that is not ready for it and that a new VM is created when a VM becomes unresponsive.

A readiness probe determines whether a VM is ready to accept service requests. If the probe fails, the VM is removed from the list of available endpoints until the VM is ready.

A liveness probe determines whether a VM is responsive. If the probe fails, the VM is deleted and a new VM is created to restore responsiveness.

You can configure readiness and liveness probes by setting the spec.readinessProbe and the spec.livenessProbe fields of the VirtualMachine object. These fields support the following tests:
