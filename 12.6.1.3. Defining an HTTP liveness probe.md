## 12.6.1.3. Defining an HTTP liveness probe

Define an HTTP liveness probe by setting the spec.livenessProbe.httpGet field of the virtual machine (VM) configuration. You can define both HTTP and TCP tests for liveness probes in the same way as readiness probes. This procedure configures a sample liveness probe with an HTTP GET test.
