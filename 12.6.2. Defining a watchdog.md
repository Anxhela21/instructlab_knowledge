## 12.6.2. Defining a watchdog

You can define a watchdog to monitor the health of the guest operating system by performing the following steps:

- 1. Configure a watchdog device for the virtual machine (VM).
- 2.  Install the watchdog agent on the guest.

The watchdog device monitors the agent and performs one of the following actions if the guest operating system is unresponsive:

- poweroff : The VM powers down immediately. If spec.running is set to true or spec.runStrategy is not set to manual , then the VM reboots.
- reset : The VM reboots in place and the guest operating system cannot react.
