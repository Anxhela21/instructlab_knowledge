## 13.1. Reviewing Virtualization Overview




The **Virtualization Overview** page provides a comprehensive view of virtualization resources, details, status, and top consumers. By gaining an insight into the overall health of OpenShift Virtualization, you can determine if intervention is required to resolve specific issues identified by examining the data.

Use the **Getting Started** resources to access quick starts, read the latest blogs on virtualization, and learn how to use operators. Obtain complete information about alerts, events, inventory, and status of virtual machines. Customize the **Top Consumer** cards to obtain data on high utilization of a specific resource by projects, virtual machines, or nodes. Click **View virtualization dashboard** for quick access to the [Dashboards](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-reviewing-vm-dashboard) page.

### 13.1.1. Prerequisites




To use the **vCPU wait** metric in the **Top Consumers** card, the `schedstats=enable` kernel argument must be applied to the `MachineConfig` object. This kernel argument enables scheduler statistics used for debugging and performance tuning and adds a minor additional load to the scheduler. See the [OpenShift Container Platform machine configuration tasks](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/post-installation_configuration/#nodes-nodes-kernel-arguments_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks) documentation for more information on applying a kernel argument.

### 13.1.2. Resources monitored actively in the Virtualization Overview page




The following table shows actively monitored resources, metrics, and fields in the **Virtualization Overview** page. This information is useful when you need to obtain relevant data and intervene to resolve a problem.

|  **Monitored resources, fields, and metrics** |  **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Details | A brief overview of service and version information for **OpenShift Virtualization** . |
| Status | Alerts for virtualization and networking. |
| Activity | Ongoing events for virtual machines. Messages are related to recent activity in the cluster, such as pod creation or virtual machine migration to another host. |
| Running VMs by Template | The donut chart displays a unique color for each virtual machine template and shows the number of running virtual machines that use each template. |
| Inventory | Total number of active virtual machines, templates, nodes, and networks. |
| Status of VMs | Current status of virtual machines: **running** , **provisioning** , **starting** , **migrating** , **paused** , **stopping** , **terminating** , and **unknown** . |
| Permissions | Tasks for which capabilities are enabled through permissions: **Access to public templates** , **Access to public boot sources** , **Clone a VM** , **Attach VM to multiple networks** , **Upload a base image from local disk** , and **Share templates** . |


### 13.1.3. Resources monitored for top consumption




The **Top Consumers** cards in **Virtualization Overview** page display projects, virtual machines or nodes with maximum consumption of a resource. You can select a project, a virtual machine, or a node and view the top five or top ten consumers of a specific resource.

Note
Viewing the maximum resource consumption is limited to the top five or top ten consumers within each **Top Consumers** card.



The following table shows resources monitored for top consumers.

|  **Resources monitored for top consumption** |  **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| CPU | Projects, virtual machines, or nodes consuming the most CPU. |
| Memory | Projects, virtual machines, or nodes consuming the most memory (in bytes). The unit of display (for example, MiB or GiB) is determined by the size of the resource consumption. |
| Used filesystem | Projects, virtual machines, or nodes with the highest consumption of filesystems (in bytes). The unit of display (for example, MiB or GiB) is determined by the size of the resource consumption. |
| Memory swap | Projects, virtual machines, or nodes consuming the most memory pressure when memory is swapped . |
| vCPU wait | Projects, virtual machines, or nodes experiencing the maximum wait time (in seconds) for the vCPUs. |
| Storage throughput | Projects, virtual machines, or nodes with the highest data transfer rate to and from the storage media (in mbps). |
| Storage IOPS | Projects, virtual machines, or nodes with the highest amount of storage IOPS (input/output operations per second) over a time period. |


### 13.1.4. Reviewing top consumers for projects, virtual machines, and nodes




You can view the top consumers of resources for a selected project, virtual machine, or node in the **Virtualization Overview** page.

 **Prerequisites** 

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `    cluster-admin` role.


 **Procedure** 

1. In the **Administrator** perspective in the OpenShift Virtualization web console, navigate to **Virtualization** → **Overview** .
1. Navigate to the **Top Consumers** cards.
1. From the drop-down menu, select **Show top 5** or **Show top 10** .
1. For a **Top Consumer** card, select the type of resource from the drop-down menu: **CPU** , **Memory** , **Used Filesystem** , **Memory Swap** , **vCPU Wait** , or **Storage Throughput** .
1. Select **By Project** , **By VM** , or **By Node** . A list of the top five or top ten consumers of the selected resource is displayed.
