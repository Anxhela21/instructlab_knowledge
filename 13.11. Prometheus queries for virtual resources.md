## 13.11. Prometheus queries for virtual resources




OpenShift Virtualization provides metrics for monitoring how infrastructure resources are consumed in the cluster. The metrics cover the following resources:

- vCPU
- Network
- Storage
- Guest memory swapping


Use the OpenShift Container Platform monitoring dashboard to query virtualization metrics.

### 13.11.1. Prerequisites




- To use the vCPU metric, the `    schedstats=enable` kernel argument must be applied to the `    MachineConfig` object. This kernel argument enables scheduler statistics used for debugging and performance tuning and adds a minor additional load to the scheduler. See the [OpenShift Container Platform machine configuration tasks](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/post-installation_configuration/#nodes-nodes-kernel-arguments_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks) documentation for more information on applying a kernel argument.
- For guest memory swapping queries to return data, memory swapping must be enabled on the virtual guests.


### 13.11.2. About querying metrics




The OpenShift Container Platform monitoring dashboard enables you to run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

As a **cluster administrator** , you can query metrics for all core OpenShift Container Platform and user-defined projects.

As a **developer** , you must specify a project name when querying metrics. You must have the required privileges to view metrics for the selected project.

#### 13.11.2.1. Querying metrics for all projects as a cluster administrator




As a cluster administrator or as a user with view permissions for all projects, you can access metrics for all default OpenShift Container Platform and user-defined projects in the Metrics UI.

 **Prerequisites** 

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `    cluster-admin` cluster role or with view permissions for all projects.
- You have installed the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).


 **Procedure** 

1. Select the **Administrator** perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.
1. Select **Observe** → **Metrics** .
1. Select **Insert Metric at Cursor** to view a list of predefined queries.
1. To create a custom query, add your Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) query to the **Expression** field.
    
    Note
    As you type a PromQL expression, autocomplete suggestions appear in a drop-down list. These suggestions include functions, metrics, labels, and time tokens. You can use the keyboard arrows to select one of these suggested items and then press Enter to add the item to your expression. You can also move your mouse pointer over a suggested item to view a brief description of that item.
    
    
    
    
1. To add multiple queries, select **Add Query** .
1. To duplicate an existing query, select![kebab](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.11-Virtualization-en-US/images/f468284ec3cc9bf27e6bd2c83849ca50/kebab.png)
    next to the query, then choose **Duplicate query** .
1. To delete a query, select![kebab](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.11-Virtualization-en-US/images/f468284ec3cc9bf27e6bd2c83849ca50/kebab.png)
    next to the query, then choose **Delete query** .
1. To disable a query from being run, select![kebab](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.11-Virtualization-en-US/images/f468284ec3cc9bf27e6bd2c83849ca50/kebab.png)
    next to the query and choose **Disable query** .
1. To run queries that you created, select **Run Queries** . The metrics from the queries are visualized on the plot. If a query is invalid, the UI shows an error message.
    
    Note
    Queries that operate on large amounts of data might time out or overload the browser when drawing time series graphs. To avoid this, select **Hide graph** and calibrate your query using only the metrics table. Then, after finding a feasible query, enable the plot to draw the graphs.
    
    
    
    
1. Optional: The page URL now contains the queries you ran. To use this set of queries again in the future, save this URL.


#### 13.11.2.2. Querying metrics for user-defined projects as a developer




You can access metrics for a user-defined project as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project.

In the **Developer** perspective, the Metrics UI includes some predefined CPU, memory, bandwidth, and network packet queries for the selected project. You can also run custom Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries for CPU, memory, bandwidth, network packet and application metrics for the project.

Note
Developers can only use the **Developer** perspective and not the **Administrator** perspective. As a developer, you can only query metrics for one project at a time in the **Observe** -→ **Metrics** page in the web console for your user-defined project.



 **Prerequisites** 

- You have access to the cluster as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project that you are viewing metrics for.
- You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
- You have deployed a service in a user-defined project.
- You have created a `    ServiceMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) for the service to define how the service is monitored.


 **Procedure** 

1. Select the **Developer** perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.
1. Select **Observe** → **Metrics** .
1. Select the project that you want to view metrics for in the **Project:** list.
1. Select a query from the **Select query** list, or create a custom PromQL query based on the selected query by selecting **Show PromQL** .
1. Optional: Select **Custom query** from the **Select query** list to enter a new query. As you type, autocomplete suggestions appear in a drop-down list. These suggestions include functions and metrics. Click a suggested item to select it.
    
    Note
    In the **Developer** perspective, you can only run one query at a time.
    
    
    
    


### 13.11.3. Virtualization metrics




The following metric descriptions include example Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries. These metrics are not an API and might change between versions.

Note
The following examples use `topk` queries that specify a time period. If virtual machines are deleted during that time period, they can still appear in the query output.



#### 13.11.3.1. vCPU metrics




The following query can identify virtual machines that are waiting for Input/Output (I/O):

A value above '0' means that the vCPU wants to run, but the host scheduler cannot run it yet. This inability to run indicates that there is an issue with I/O.

Note
To query the vCPU metric, the `schedstats=enable` kernel argument must first be applied to the `MachineConfig` object. This kernel argument enables scheduler statistics used for debugging and performance tuning and adds a minor additional load to the scheduler.



 **Example vCPU wait time query** 

```
topk(3, sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_vcpu_wait_seconds[6m]))) &gt; 0<span id="CO122-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```


#### 13.11.3.2. Network metrics




The following queries can identify virtual machines that are saturating the network:

 **Example network traffic query** 

```
topk(3, sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_network_receive_bytes_total[6m])) + sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_network_transmit_bytes_total[6m]))) &gt; 0<span id="CO123-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```


#### 13.11.3.3. Storage metrics




##### 13.11.3.3.1. Storage-related traffic




The following queries can identify VMs that are writing large amounts of data:

 **Example storage-related traffic query** 

```
topk(3, sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_storage_read_traffic_bytes_total[6m])) + sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_storage_write_traffic_bytes_total[6m]))) &gt; 0<span id="CO124-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```


##### 13.11.3.3.2. Storage snapshot data




 **Examples of storage snapshot data queries** 

```
kubevirt_vmsnapshot_disks_restored_from_source_total{vm_name="simple-vm", vm_namespace="default"}<span id="CO125-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```


```
kubevirt_vmsnapshot_disks_restored_from_source_bytes{vm_name="simple-vm", vm_namespace="default"}<span id="CO126-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```

##### 13.11.3.3.3. I/O performance




The following queries can determine the I/O performance of storage devices:

 **Example I/O performance query** 

```
topk(3, sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_storage_iops_read_total[6m])) + sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_storage_iops_write_total[6m]))) &gt; 0<span id="CO127-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```


#### 13.11.3.4. Guest memory swapping metrics




The following queries can identify which swap-enabled guests are performing the most memory swapping:

 **Example memory swapping query** 

```
topk(3, sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_memory_swap_in_traffic_bytes_total[6m])) + sum by (name, namespace) (rate(kubevirt_vmi_memory_swap_out_traffic_bytes_total[6m]))) &gt; 0<span id="CO128-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```


Note
Memory swapping indicates that the virtual machine is under memory pressure. Increasing the memory allocation of the virtual machine can mitigate this issue.
