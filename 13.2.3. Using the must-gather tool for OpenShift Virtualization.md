## 13.2.3. Using the must-gather tool for OpenShift Virtualization

You can collect data about OpenShift Virtualization resources by running the must-gather command with the OpenShift Virtualization image.

The default data collection includes information about the following resources:

- OpenShift Virtualization Operator namespaces, including child objects
- OpenShift Virtualization custom resource definitions
- Namespaces that contain virtual machines
- Basic virtual machine definitions

Instance types information is not currently collected by default; you can, however, run a command to optionally collect it.
