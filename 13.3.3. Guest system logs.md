## 13.3.3. Guest system logs

Viewing the boot logs of VM guests can help diagnose issues. You can configure access to guests' logs and view them by using either the OpenShift Container Platform web console or the oc CLI.

This feature is disabled by default. If a VM does not explicitly have this setting enabled or disabled, it inherits the cluster-wide default setting.
