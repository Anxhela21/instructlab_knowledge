## 13.7. Using the OpenShift Container Platform dashboard to get cluster information




Access the OpenShift Container Platform dashboard, which captures high-level information about the cluster, by clicking **Home > Dashboards > Overview** from the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

The OpenShift Container Platform dashboard provides various cluster information, captured in individual dashboard _cards_ .

### 13.7.1. About the OpenShift Container Platform dashboards page




Access the OpenShift Container Platform dashboard, which captures high-level information about the cluster, by navigating to **Home** → **Overview** from the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

The OpenShift Container Platform dashboard provides various cluster information, captured in individual dashboard cards.

The OpenShift Container Platform dashboard consists of the following cards:

-  **Details** provides a brief overview of informational cluster details.
    
    Status include **ok** , **error** , **warning** , **in progress** , and **unknown** . Resources can add custom status names.
    
    
    - Cluster ID
    - Provider
    - Version
    
-  **Cluster Inventory** details number of resources and associated statuses. It is helpful when intervention is required to resolve problems, including information about:
    
    
    - Number of nodes
    - Number of pods
    - Persistent storage volume claims
    - Virtual machines (available if OpenShift Virtualization is installed)
    - Bare metal hosts in the cluster, listed according to their state (only available in **metal3** environment).
    
-  **Cluster Health** summarizes the current health of the cluster as a whole, including relevant alerts and descriptions. If OpenShift Virtualization is installed, the overall health of OpenShift Virtualization is diagnosed as well. If more than one subsystem is present, click **See All** to view the status of each subsystem.
    
    
    - Bare metal hosts in the cluster, listed according to their state (only available in **metal3** environment)
    
-  **Status** helps administrators understand how cluster resources are consumed. Click on a resource to jump to a detailed page listing pods and nodes that consume the largest amount of the specified cluster resource (CPU, memory, or storage).
-  **Cluster Utilization** shows the capacity of various resources over a specified period of time, to help administrators understand the scale and frequency of high resource consumption, including information about:
    
    
    - CPU time
    - Memory allocation
    - Storage consumed
    - Network resources consumed
    - Pod count
    
-  **Activity** lists messages related to recent activity in the cluster, such as pod creation or virtual machine migration to another host.
