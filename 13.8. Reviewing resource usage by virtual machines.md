## 13.8. Reviewing resource usage by virtual machines




Dashboards in the OpenShift Container Platform web console provide visual representations of cluster metrics to help you to quickly understand the state of your cluster. Dashboards belong to the [Monitoring overview](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/monitoring/#monitoring-overview) that provides monitoring for core platform components.

The OpenShift Virtualization dashboard provides data on resource consumption for virtual machines and associated pods. The visualization metrics displayed in the OpenShift Virtualization dashboard are based on [Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-prometheus-queries) .

A [monitoring role](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/monitoring/#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects) is required to monitor user-defined namespaces in the OpenShift Virtualization dashboard.

### 13.8.1. About reviewing top consumers




In the OpenShift Virtualization dashboard, you can select a specific time period and view the top consumers of resources within that time period. Top consumers are virtual machines or `virt-launcher` pods that are consuming the highest amount of resources.

The following table shows resources monitored in the dashboard and describes the metrics associated with each resource for top consumers.

|  **Monitored resources** |  **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Memory swap traffic | Virtual machines consuming the most memory pressure when swapping memory. |
| vCPU wait | Virtual machines experiencing the maximum wait time (in seconds) for their vCPUs. |
| CPU usage by pod | The `virt-launcher` pods that are using the most CPU. |
| Network traffic | Virtual machines that are saturating the network by receiving the most amount of network traffic (in bytes). |
| Storage traffic | Virtual machines with the highest amount (in bytes) of storage-related traffic. |
| Storage IOPS | Virtual machines with the highest amount of I/O operations per second over a time period. |
| Memory usage | The `virt-launcher` pods that are using the most memory (in bytes). |


Note
Viewing the maximum resource consumption is limited to the top five consumers.



### 13.8.2. Reviewing top consumers




In the **Administrator** perspective, you can view the OpenShift Virtualization dashboard where top consumers of resources are displayed.

 **Prerequisites** 

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `    cluster-admin` role.


 **Procedure** 

1. In the **Administrator** perspective in the OpenShift Virtualization web console, navigate to **Observe** → **Dashboards** .
1. Select the **KubeVirt/Infrastructure Resources/Top Consumers** dashboard from the **Dashboard** list.
1. Select a predefined time period from the drop-down menu for **Period.** You can review the data for top consumers in the tables.
1. Optional: Click **Inspect** to view or edit the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) query associated with the top consumers for a table.
