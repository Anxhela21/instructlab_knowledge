## 13.9. OpenShift Container Platform cluster monitoring, logging, and Telemetry




OpenShift Container Platform provides various resources for monitoring at the cluster level.

### 13.9.1. About OpenShift Container Platform monitoring




OpenShift Container Platform includes a preconfigured, preinstalled, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides **monitoring for core platform components** . OpenShift Container Platform delivers monitoring best practices out of the box. A set of alerts are included by default that immediately notify cluster administrators about issues with a cluster. Default dashboards in the OpenShift Container Platform web console include visual representations of cluster metrics to help you to quickly understand the state of your cluster.

After installing OpenShift Container Platform 4.11, cluster administrators can optionally enable **monitoring for user-defined projects** . By using this feature, cluster administrators, developers, and other users can specify how services and pods are monitored in their own projects. You can then query metrics, review dashboards, and manage alerting rules and silences for your own projects in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Note
Cluster administrators can grant developers and other users permission to monitor their own projects. Privileges are granted by assigning one of the predefined monitoring roles.



### 13.9.2. Logging architecture




The major components of the logging are:

Logging collects container logs and node logs. These are categorized into types:

For more information on OpenShift Logging, see the [OpenShift Logging](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/logging/#cluster-logging) documentation.

### 13.9.3. About Telemetry




Telemetry sends a carefully chosen subset of the cluster monitoring metrics to Red Hat. The Telemeter Client fetches the metrics values every four minutes and thirty seconds and uploads the data to Red Hat. These metrics are described in this document.

This stream of data is used by Red Hat to monitor the clusters in real-time and to react as necessary to problems that impact our customers. It also allows Red Hat to roll out OpenShift Container Platform upgrades to customers to minimize service impact and continuously improve the upgrade experience.

This debugging information is available to Red Hat Support and Engineering teams with the same restrictions as accessing data reported through support cases. All connected cluster information is used by Red Hat to help make OpenShift Container Platform better and more intuitive to use.

#### 13.9.3.1. Information collected by Telemetry




The following information is collected by Telemetry:

##### 13.9.3.1.1. System information




- Version information, including the OpenShift Container Platform cluster version and installed update details that are used to determine update version availability
- Update information, including the number of updates available per cluster, the channel and image repository used for an update, update progress information, and the number of errors that occur in an update
- The unique random identifier that is generated during an installation
- Configuration details that help Red Hat Support to provide beneficial support for customers, including node configuration at the cloud infrastructure level, hostnames, IP addresses, Kubernetes pod names, namespaces, and services
- The OpenShift Container Platform framework components installed in a cluster and their condition and status
- Events for all namespaces listed as "related objects" for a degraded Operator
- Information about degraded software
- Information about the validity of certificates
- The name of the provider platform that OpenShift Container Platform is deployed on and the data center location


##### 13.9.3.1.2. Sizing Information




- Sizing information about clusters, machine types, and machines, including the number of CPU cores and the amount of RAM used for each
- The number of running virtual machine instances in a cluster
- The number of etcd members and the number of objects stored in the etcd cluster
- Number of application builds by build strategy type


##### 13.9.3.1.3. Usage information




- Usage information about components, features, and extensions
- Usage details about Technology Previews and unsupported configurations


Telemetry does not collect identifying information such as usernames or passwords. Red Hat does not intend to collect personal information. If Red Hat discovers that personal information has been inadvertently received, Red Hat will delete such information. To the extent that any telemetry data constitutes personal data, please refer to the [Red Hat Privacy Statement](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/privacy-policy) for more information about Red Hat’s privacy practices.

### 13.9.4. CLI troubleshooting and debugging commands




For a list of the `oc` client troubleshooting and debugging commands, see the [OpenShift Container Platform CLI tools](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/cli_tools/#cli-developer-commands) documentation.
