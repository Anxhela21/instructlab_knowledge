## 14.3.1.1. Metro-DR

Metro-DR uses synchronous replication. It writes to storage at both the primary and secondary sites so that the data is always synchronized between sites. Because the storage provider is responsible for ensuring that the synchronization succeeds, the environment must meet the throughput and latency requirements of the storage provider.
