## 14.3.2.2. Best practices when defining an RHACM-discovered VM

You can configure any VM in the cluster that is not an RHACM-managed application as an RHACMdiscovered application. This includes VMs imported by using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV), VMs created by using the OpenShift Virtualization web console, or VMs created by any other means, such as the CLI.

There are several actions you can take to improve your experience and chance of success when defining an RHACM-discovered VM.

Because automatic labeling is not currently available, the application owner must manually label the components of the VM application when using MTV, the OpenShift Virtualization web console, or a custom VM.

After creating the VM, apply a common label to the following resources associated with the VM: VirtualMachine , DataVolume , PersistentVolumeClaim , Service , Route , Secret , ConfigMap , VirtualMachinePreference , and VirtualMachineInstancetype . Do not label virtual machine instances (VMIs) or pods; OpenShift Virtualization creates and manages these automatically.
