## 2.1.5.2. Removed features

Removed features are those that were deprecated in earlier releases. They are now removed from OpenShift Virtualization and are no longer supported.

- CentOS 7 and CentOS Stream 8 are now in the End of Life phase. As a consequence, the container images for these operating systems have been removed from OpenShift Virtualization and are no longer community supported.
- The tekton-tasks-operator is removed. The Tekton tasks and example pipelines are now available in the task catalog (ArtifactHub).
