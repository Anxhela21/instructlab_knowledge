## 4.3. New and changed features




- You can now deploy OpenShift Virtualization on a [three-node cluster](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/installing/#installation-three-node-cluster_installing-bare-metal) with zero compute nodes.


- Virtual machines run as unprivileged workloads in _session mode_ by default. This feature improves cluster security by mitigating escalation-of-privilege attacks.


- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 is now supported as a guest operating system.


- The link for installing the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) Operator in the OpenShift Container Platform web console has been moved. It is now located in the **Related operators** section of the **Getting started resources** card on the **Virtualization** → **Overview** page.


- You can configure the [verbosity level](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-logs) of the `    virtLauncher` , `    virtHandler` , `    virtController` , `    virtAPI` , and `    virtOperator` pod logs to debug specific components by editing the `    HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).


### 4.3.1. Quick starts




- Quick start tours are available for several OpenShift Virtualization features. To view the tours, click the **Help** icon **?** in the menu bar on the header of the OpenShift Virtualization console and then select **Quick Starts** . You can filter the available tours by entering the `    virtualization` keyword in the **Filter** field.


### 4.3.2. Storage




- New metrics are available that provide information about [virtual machine snapshots](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-storage-snapshot-data_virt-prometheus-queries) .


- You can reduce the number of logs on disconnected environments or reduce resource usage by [disabling the automatic imports and updates for a boot source](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-disable-individual-bootsource-update_virt-automatic-bootsource-updates) .


### 4.3.3. Web console




- You can set the [boot mode](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-editing-vm-web_virt-edit-vms) of templates and virtual machines to **BIOS** , **UEFI** , or **UEFI (secure)** by using the web console.
- You can now enable and disable the descheduler from the web console on the **Scheduling** tab of the [VirtualMachine details](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-vm-fields-web_virt-create-vms) page.


- You can access virtual machines by navigating to **Virtualization** → **VirtualMachines** in the side menu. Each virtual machine now has an [updated Overview tab](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-about-the-vm-dashboard_virt-viewing-information-about-vm-workloads) that provides information about the virtual machine configuration, alerts, snapshots, network interfaces, disks, usage data, and hardware devices.
- The **Create a Virtual Machine** wizard in the web console is now [replaced by the Catalog page](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-quick-creating-vm_virt-create-vms) , which lists available templates that you can use to create a virtual machine. You can use a template with an available boot source to quickly create a virtual machine or you can customize a template to create a virtual machine.
- If your Windows virtual machine has a vGPU attached, you can now [switch between the default display and the vGPU display](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-switching-displays_virt-accessing-vm-consoles) by using the web console.


- You can access virtual machine templates by navigating to **Virtualization** → **Templates** in the side menu. The updated **VirtualMachine Templates** page now provides useful information about each template, including workload profile, boot source, and CPU and memory configuration.


- The **Create Template** wizard has been removed from the **VirtualMachine Templates** page. You [create a virtual machine template](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-creating-template_virt-creating-vm-template) by editing a YAML file example.
