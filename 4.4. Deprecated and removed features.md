## 4.4. Deprecated and removed features




### 4.4.1. Deprecated features




Deprecated features are included in the current release and supported. However, they will be removed in a future release and are not recommended for new deployments.

- In a future release, support for the legacy HPP custom resource, and the associated storage class, will be deprecated. Beginning in OpenShift Virtualization 4.11, the HPP Operator uses the Kubernetes Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver to configure local storage. The Operator continues to support the existing (legacy) format of the HPP custom resource and the associated storage class. If you use the HPP Operator, plan to [create a storage class for the CSI driver](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-configuring-local-storage-for-vms) as part of your migration strategy.


### 4.4.2. Removed features




Removed features are not supported in the current release.

- OpenShift Virtualization 4.11 removes support for [nmstate](https://nmstate.io/) , including the following objects:
    
    
    -  `        NodeNetworkState` 
    -  `        NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` 
    -  `        NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment` 
    To preserve and support your existing nmstate configuration, install the [Kubernetes NMState Operator](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/networking/#k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator) before updating to OpenShift Virtualization 4.11. You can install it from the **OperatorHub** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, or by using the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).
    
    
- The Node Maintenance Operator (NMO) is no longer shipped with OpenShift Virtualization. You can [install the NMO](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/nodes/#node-maintenance-operator) from the **OperatorHub** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, or by using the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).
    
    You must perform one of the following tasks before updating to OpenShift Virtualization 4.11 from OpenShift Virtualization 4.10.2 and later releases:
    
    
    - Move all nodes out of maintenance mode.
    - Install the standalone NMO and replace the `        nodemaintenances.nodemaintenance.kubevirt.io` custom resource (CR) with a `        nodemaintenances.nodemaintenance.medik8s.io` CR.
    
- You can no longer mark virtual machine templates as favorites.
