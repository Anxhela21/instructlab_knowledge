## 5.2. Specifying nodes for OpenShift Virtualization components




Specify the nodes where you want to deploy OpenShift Virtualization Operators, workloads, and controllers by configuring node placement rules.

Note
You can configure node placement for some components after installing OpenShift Virtualization, but there must not be virtual machines present if you want to configure node placement for workloads.



### 5.2.1. About node placement for virtualization components




You might want to customize where OpenShift Virtualization deploys its components to ensure that:

- Virtual machines only deploy on nodes that are intended for virtualization workloads.
- Operators only deploy on infrastructure nodes.
- Certain nodes are unaffected by OpenShift Virtualization. For example, you have workloads unrelated to virtualization running on your cluster, and you want those workloads to be isolated from OpenShift Virtualization.


#### 5.2.1.1. How to apply node placement rules to virtualization components




You can specify node placement rules for a component by editing the corresponding object directly or by using the web console.

- For the OpenShift Virtualization Operators that Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) deploys, edit the OLM `    Subscription` object directly. Currently, you cannot configure node placement rules for the `    Subscription` object by using the web console.
- For components that the OpenShift Virtualization Operators deploy, edit the `    HyperConverged` object directly or configure it by using the web console during OpenShift Virtualization installation.
- For the hostpath provisioner, edit the `    HostPathProvisioner` object directly or configure it by using the web console.
    
    Warning
    You must schedule the hostpath provisioner and the virtualization components on the same nodes. Otherwise, virtualization pods that use the hostpath provisioner cannot run.
    
    
    
    


Depending on the object, you can use one or more of the following rule types:

#### 5.2.1.2. Node placement in the OLM Subscription object




To specify the nodes where OLM deploys the OpenShift Virtualization Operators, edit the `Subscription` object during OpenShift Virtualization installation. You can include node placement rules in the `spec.config` field, as shown in the following example:

```
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: hco-operatorhub
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  startingCSV: kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v4.11.8
  channel: "stable"
  config:<span id="CO3-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```

#### 5.2.1.3. Node placement in the HyperConverged object




To specify the nodes where OpenShift Virtualization deploys its components, you can include the `nodePlacement` object in the HyperConverged Cluster custom resource (CR) file that you create during OpenShift Virtualization installation. You can include `nodePlacement` under the `spec.infra` and `spec.workloads` fields, as shown in the following example:

```
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  infra:
    nodePlacement:<span id="CO4-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>...
  workloads:
    nodePlacement:
    ...
```

#### 5.2.1.4. Node placement in the HostPathProvisioner object




You can configure node placement rules in the `spec.workload` field of the `HostPathProvisioner` object that you create when you install the hostpath provisioner.

```
apiVersion: hostpathprovisioner.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HostPathProvisioner
metadata:
  name: hostpath-provisioner
spec:
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  pathConfig:
    path: "&lt;/path/to/backing/directory&gt;"
    useNamingPrefix: false
  workload:<span id="CO5-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
```

### 5.2.2. Example manifests




The following example YAML files use `nodePlacement` , `affinity` , and `tolerations` objects to customize node placement for OpenShift Virtualization components.

#### 5.2.2.1. Operator Lifecycle Manager Subscription object




##### 5.2.2.1.1. Example: Node placement with nodeSelector in the OLM Subscription object




In this example, `nodeSelector` is configured so that OLM places the OpenShift Virtualization Operators on nodes that are labeled with `example.io/example-infra-key = example-infra-value` .

```
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: hco-operatorhub
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  startingCSV: kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v4.11.8
  channel: "stable"
  config:
    nodeSelector:
      example.io/example-infra-key: example-infra-value
```

##### 5.2.2.1.2. Example: Node placement with tolerations in the OLM Subscription object




In this example, nodes that are reserved for OLM to deploy OpenShift Virtualization Operators are labeled with the `key=virtualization:NoSchedule` taint. Only pods with the matching tolerations are scheduled to these nodes.

```
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: hco-operatorhub
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  startingCSV: kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v4.11.8
  channel: "stable"
  config:
    tolerations:
    - key: "key"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "virtualization"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

#### 5.2.2.2. HyperConverged object




##### 5.2.2.2.1. Example: Node placement with nodeSelector in the HyperConverged Cluster CR




In this example, `nodeSelector` is configured so that infrastructure resources are placed on nodes that are labeled with `example.io/example-infra-key = example-infra-value` and workloads are placed on nodes labeled with `example.io/example-workloads-key = example-workloads-value` .

```
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:

##### 5.2.2.2.2. Example: Node placement with affinity in the HyperConverged Cluster CR




In this example, `affinity` is configured so that infrastructure resources are placed on nodes that are labeled with `example.io/example-infra-key = example-value` and workloads are placed on nodes labeled with `example.io/example-workloads-key = example-workloads-value` . Nodes that have more than eight CPUs are preferred for workloads, but if they are not available, pods are still scheduled.

                operator: Gt
                values:
                - 8
```

##### 5.2.2.2.3. Example: Node placement with tolerations in the HyperConverged Cluster CR
