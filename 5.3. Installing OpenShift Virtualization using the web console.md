## 5.3. Installing OpenShift Virtualization using the web console




Install OpenShift Virtualization to add virtualization functionality to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 [web console](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/web_console/#web-console-overview_web-console) to subscribe to and deploy the OpenShift Virtualization Operators.

### 5.3.1. Installing the OpenShift Virtualization Operator




You can install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

 **Prerequisites** 

- Install OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 on your cluster.
- Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with `    cluster-admin` permissions.


 **Procedure** 

1. From the **Administrator** perspective, click **Operators** → **OperatorHub** .
1. In the **Filter by keyword** field, type **Virtualization** .
1. Select the **{CNVOperatorDisplayName}** tile with the **Red Hat** source label.
1. Read the information about the Operator and click **Install** .
1. On the **Install Operator** page:
    
    
    1. Select **stable** from the list of available **Update Channel** options. This ensures that you install the version of OpenShift Virtualization that is compatible with your OpenShift Container Platform version.
    1. For **Installed Namespace** , ensure that the **Operator recommended namespace** option is selected. This installs the Operator in the mandatory `        openshift-cnv` namespace, which is automatically created if it does not exist.
        
        Warning
        Attempting to install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator in a namespace other than `        openshift-cnv` causes the installation to fail.
        
        
        
        
    1. For **Approval Strategy** , it is highly recommended that you select **Automatic** , which is the default value, so that OpenShift Virtualization automatically updates when a new version is available in the **stable** update channel.
        
        While it is possible to select the **Manual** approval strategy, this is inadvisable because of the high risk that it presents to the supportability and functionality of your cluster. Only select **Manual** if you fully understand these risks and cannot use **Automatic** .
        
        Warning
        Because OpenShift Virtualization is only supported when used with the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform version, missing OpenShift Virtualization updates can cause your cluster to become unsupported.
        
        
        
        
    
1. Click **Install** to make the Operator available to the `    openshift-cnv` namespace.
1. When the Operator installs successfully, click **Create HyperConverged** .
1. Optional: Configure **Infra** and **Workloads** node placement options for OpenShift Virtualization components.
1. Click **Create** to launch OpenShift Virtualization.


 **Verification** 

- Navigate to the **Workloads** → **Pods** page and monitor the OpenShift Virtualization pods until they are all **Running** . After all the pods display the **Running** state, you can use OpenShift Virtualization.


### 5.3.2. Next steps




You might want to additionally configure the following components:

- The [hostpath provisioner](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-creating-hpp-basic-storage-pool_virt-configuring-local-storage-for-vms) is a local storage provisioner designed for OpenShift Virtualization. If you want to configure local storage for virtual machines, you must enable the hostpath provisioner first.
