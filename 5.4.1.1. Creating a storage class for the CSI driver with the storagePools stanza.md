## 5.4.1.1. Creating a storage class for the CSI driver with the storagePools stanza

To use the hostpath provisioner (HPP) you must create an associated storage class for the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver.

When you create a storage class, you set parameters that affect the dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes (PVs) that belong to that storage class. You cannot update a StorageClass object's parameters after you create it.
