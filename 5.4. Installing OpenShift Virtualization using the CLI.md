## 5.4. Installing OpenShift Virtualization using the CLI




Install OpenShift Virtualization to add virtualization functionality to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You can subscribe to and deploy the OpenShift Virtualization Operators by using the command line to apply manifests to your cluster.

Note
To specify the nodes where you want OpenShift Virtualization to install its components, [configure node placement rules](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-specifying-nodes-for-virtualization-components) .



### 5.4.1. Prerequisites




- Install OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 on your cluster.
- Install the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).
- Log in as a user with `    cluster-admin` privileges.


### 5.4.2. Subscribing to the OpenShift Virtualization catalog by using the CLI




Before you install OpenShift Virtualization, you must subscribe to the OpenShift Virtualization catalog. Subscribing gives the `openshift-cnv` namespace access to the OpenShift Virtualization Operators.

To subscribe, configure `Namespace` , `OperatorGroup` , and `Subscription` objects by applying a single manifest to your cluster.

 **Procedure** 

1. Create a YAML file that contains the following manifest:
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: v1    kind: Namespace    metadata:      name: openshift-cnv    ---    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1    kind: OperatorGroup    metadata:      name: kubevirt-hyperconverged-group      namespace: openshift-cnv    spec:      targetNamespaces:        - openshift-cnv    ---    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1    kind: Subscription    metadata:      name: hco-operatorhub      namespace: openshift-cnv    spec:      source: redhat-operators      sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace      name: kubevirt-hyperconverged      startingCSV: kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v4.11.8      channel: "stable"<span id="CO6-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
    ```
    
    
1. Create the required `    Namespace` , `    OperatorGroup` , and `    Subscription` objects for OpenShift Virtualization by running the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc apply -f &lt;file name&gt;.yaml
    ```
    
    


Note
You can [configure certificate rotation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-configuring-certificate-rotation) parameters in the YAML file.



### 5.4.3. Deploying the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by using the CLI




You can deploy the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by using the `oc` CLI.

 **Prerequisites** 

- An active subscription to the OpenShift Virtualization catalog in the `    openshift-cnv` namespace.


 **Procedure** 

1. Create a YAML file that contains the following manifest:
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1    kind: HyperConverged    metadata:      name: kubevirt-hyperconverged      namespace: openshift-cnv    spec:
    ```
    
    
1. Deploy the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by running the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc apply -f &lt;file_name&gt;.yaml
    ```
    
    


 **Verification** 

- Ensure that OpenShift Virtualization deployed successfully by watching the `    PHASE` of the cluster service version (CSV) in the `    openshift-cnv` namespace. Run the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ watch oc get csv -n openshift-cnv
    ```
    
    The following output displays if deployment was successful:
    
     **Example output** 
    
    
    ```
    NAME                                      DISPLAY                    VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE    kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v4.11.8   OpenShift Virtualization   4.11.8                Succeeded
    ```
    
    
    


### 5.4.4. Next steps




You might want to additionally configure the following components:

- The [hostpath provisioner](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-creating-hpp-basic-storage-pool_virt-configuring-local-storage-for-vms) is a local storage provisioner designed for OpenShift Virtualization. If you want to configure local storage for virtual machines, you must enable the hostpath provisioner first.
