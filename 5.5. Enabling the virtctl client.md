## 5.5. Enabling the virtctl client




The `virtctl` client is a command-line utility for managing OpenShift Virtualization resources. It is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows distributions.

### 5.5.1. Downloading and installing the virtctl client




#### 5.5.1.1. Downloading the virtctl client




Download the `virtctl` client by using the link provided in the `ConsoleCLIDownload` custom resource (CR).

 **Procedure** 

1. View the `    ConsoleCLIDownload` object by running the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc get ConsoleCLIDownload virtctl-clidownloads-kubevirt-hyperconverged -o yaml
    ```
    
    
1. Download the `    virtctl` client by using the link listed for your distribution.


#### 5.5.1.2. Installing the virtctl client




Extract and install the `virtctl` client after downloading from the appropriate location for your operating system.

 **Prerequisites** 

- You must have downloaded the `    virtctl` client.


 **Procedure** 

- For Linux:
    
    
    1. Extract the tarball. The following CLI command extracts it into the same directory as the tarball:
        
        
        ```
        $ tar -xvf &lt;virtctl-version-distribution.arch&gt;.tar.gz
        ```
        
        
    1. Navigate the extracted folder hierachy and run the following command to make the `        virtctl` binary executable:
        
        
        ```
        $ chmod +x &lt;virtctl-file-name&gt;
        ```
        
        
    1. Move the `        virtctl` binary to a directory in your `        PATH` environment variable.
    1. To check your path, run the following command:
        
        
        ```
        $ echo $PATH
        ```
        
        
    
- For Windows users:
    
    
    1. Unpack and unzip the archive.
    1. Navigate the extracted folder hierarchy and double-click the `        virtctl` executable file to install the client.
    1. Move the `        virtctl` binary to a directory in your `        PATH` environment variable.
    1. To check your path, run the following command:
        
        
        ```
        C:\&gt; path
        ```
        
        
    
- For macOS users:
    
    
    1. Unpack and unzip the archive.
    1. Move the `        virtctl` binary to a directory in your `        PATH` environment variable.
    1. To check your path, run the following command:
        
        
        ```
        echo $PATH
        ```
        
        
    


### 5.5.2. Installing the virtctl RPM package




You can install the `virtctl` client as an RPM after enabling the OpenShift Virtualization repository.

#### 5.5.2.1. Enabling OpenShift Virtualization repositories




Enable the OpenShift Virtualization repository for your version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

 **Prerequisites** 

- Your system is registered to a Red Hat account with an active subscription to the "Red Hat Container Native Virtualization" entitlement.


 **Procedure** 

- Enable the appropriate OpenShift Virtualization repository for your operating system by using the `    subscription-manager` CLI tool.
    
    
    - To enable the repository for RHEL 8, run:
        
        
        ```
        # subscription-manager repos --enable cnv-4.11-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
        ```
        
        
    - To enable the repository for RHEL 7, run:
        
        
        ```
        # subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-cnv-4.11-rpms
        ```
        
        
    


#### 5.5.2.2. Installing the virtctl client using the yum utility




Install the `virtctl` client from the `kubevirt-virtctl` package.

 **Prerequisites** 

- You enabled an OpenShift Virtualization repository on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system.


 **Procedure** 

- Install the `    kubevirt-virtctl` package:
    
    
    ```
    # yum install kubevirt-virtctl
    ```
