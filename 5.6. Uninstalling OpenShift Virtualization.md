Important
You must first delete all [virtual machines](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-delete-vm-web_virt-delete-vms) , [virtual machine instances](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-deleting-vmis-cli_virt-manage-vmis) , and [data volumes](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-deleting-dvs_virt-deleting-datavolumes) .

You cannot uninstall OpenShift Virtualization while its workloads remain on the cluster.



#### 5.6.1.1. Deleting the HyperConverged custom resource




To uninstall OpenShift Virtualization, you first delete the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

 **Prerequisites** 

- You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with `    cluster-admin` permissions.


 **Procedure** 

1. Navigate to the **Operators** → **Installed Operators** page.
1. Select the OpenShift Virtualization Operator.
1. Click the **OpenShift Virtualization Deployment** tab.
1. Click the Options menu![kebab](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.11-Virtualization-en-US/images/f468284ec3cc9bf27e6bd2c83849ca50/kebab.png)
    beside `    kubevirt-hyperconverged` and select **Delete HyperConverged** .
1. Click **Delete** in the confirmation window.


#### 5.6.1.2. Deleting Operators from a cluster using the web console




Cluster administrators can delete installed Operators from a selected namespace by using the web console.

 **Prerequisites** 

- You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster web console using an account with `    cluster-admin` permissions.


 **Procedure** 

1. Navigate to the **Operators** → **Installed Operators** page.
1. Scroll or enter a keyword into the **Filter by name** field to find the Operator that you want to remove. Then, click on it.
1. On the right side of the **Operator Details** page, select **Uninstall Operator** from the **Actions** list.
    
    An **Uninstall Operator?** dialog box is displayed.
    
    
1. Select **Uninstall** to remove the Operator, Operator deployments, and pods. Following this action, the Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.
    
    Note
    This action does not remove resources managed by the Operator, including custom resource definitions (CRDs) and custom resources (CRs). Dashboards and navigation items enabled by the web console and off-cluster resources that continue to run might need manual clean up. To remove these after uninstalling the Operator, you might need to manually delete the Operator CRDs.
    
    
    
    


#### 5.6.1.3. Deleting a namespace using the web console

    ```
    $ oc delete crd -l operators.coreos.com/kubevirt-hyperconverged.openshift-cnv
    ```
    
    


# Chapter 6. Updating OpenShift Virtualization




Learn how Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) delivers z-stream and minor version updates for OpenShift Virtualization.

Note
- The Node Maintenance Operator (NMO) is no longer shipped with OpenShift Virtualization. You can [install the NMO](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/nodes/#node-maintenance-operator) from the **OperatorHub** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, or by using the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).
    
    You must perform one of the following tasks before updating to OpenShift Virtualization 4.11 from OpenShift Virtualization 4.10.2 and later releases:
    
    
    - Move all nodes out of maintenance mode.
    - Install the standalone NMO and replace the `        nodemaintenances.nodemaintenance.kubevirt.io` custom resource (CR) with a `        nodemaintenances.nodemaintenance.medik8s.io` CR.
