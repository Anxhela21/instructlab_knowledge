## 6.1.1.1. RHEL 9 machine type

All VM templates that are included with OpenShift Virtualization now use the RHEL 9 machine type by default: machineType: pc-q35-rhel9.<y>.0 , where <y> is a single digit corresponding to the latest minor version of RHEL 9. For example, the value pc-q35-rhel9.2.0 is used for RHEL 9.2.

Updating OpenShift Virtualization does not change the machineType value of any existing VMs. These VMs continue to function as they did before the update. You can optionally change a VM's machine type so that it can benefit from RHEL 9 improvements.
