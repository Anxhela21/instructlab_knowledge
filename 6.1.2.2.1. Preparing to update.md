## 6.1.2.2.1. Preparing to update

Before beginning a Control Plane Only update, you must:

- Pause worker nodes' machine config pools before you start a Control Plane Only update so that the workers are not rebooted twice.
- Disable automatic workload updates before you begin the update process. This is to prevent OpenShift Virtualization from migrating or evicting your virtual machines (VMs) until you update to your target EUS version.
