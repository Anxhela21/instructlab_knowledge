## 6.2. Configuring automatic workload updates




### 6.2.1. About workload updates




When you update OpenShift Virtualization, virtual machine workloads, including `libvirt` , `virt-launcher` , and `qemu` , update automatically if they support live migration.

Note
Each virtual machine has a `virt-launcher` pod that runs the virtual machine instance (VMI). The `virt-launcher` pod runs an instance of `libvirt` , which is used to manage the virtual machine (VM) process.



You can configure how workloads are updated by editing the `spec.workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza of the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR). There are two available workload update methods: `LiveMigrate` and `Evict` .

Because the `Evict` method shuts down VMI pods, only the `LiveMigrate` update strategy is enabled by default.

When `LiveMigrate` is the only update strategy enabled:

- VMIs that support live migration are migrated during the update process. The VM guest moves into a new pod with the updated components enabled.
- VMIs that do not support live migration are not disrupted or updated.
    
    
    - If a VMI has the `        LiveMigrate` eviction strategy but does not support live migration, it is not updated.
    


If you enable both `LiveMigrate` and `Evict` :

- VMIs that support live migration use the `    LiveMigrate` update strategy.
- VMIs that do not support live migration use the `    Evict` update strategy. If a VMI is controlled by a `    VirtualMachine` object that has a `    runStrategy` value of `    always` , a new VMI is created in a new pod with updated components.

##### Migration attempts and timeouts


When updating workloads, live migration fails if a pod is in the `Pending` state for the following periods:

When a VMI fails to migrate, the `virt-controller` tries to migrate it again. It repeats this process until all migratable VMIs are running on new `virt-launcher` pods. If a VMI is improperly configured, however, these attempts can repeat indefinitely.

Note
Each attempt corresponds to a migration object. Only the five most recent attempts are held in a buffer. This prevents migration objects from accumulating on the system while retaining information for debugging.



### 6.2.2. Configuring workload update methods




You can configure workload update methods by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

 **Prerequisites** 

- To use live migration as an update method, you must first enable live migration in the cluster.
    
    Note
    If a `    VirtualMachineInstance` CR contains `    evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate` and the virtual machine instance (VMI) does not support live migration, the VMI will not update.
    
    
    
    


 **Procedure** 

1. To open the `    HyperConverged` CR in your default editor, run the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc edit hco -n openshift-cnv kubevirt-hyperconverged
    ```
    
    
1. Edit the `    workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza of the `    HyperConverged` CR. For example:
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1    kind: HyperConverged    metadata:      name: kubevirt-hyperconverged    spec:      workloadUpdateStrategy:        workloadUpdateMethods:<span id="CO7-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>- LiveMigrate<span id="CO7-2"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">2</span>- Evict<span id="CO7-3"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">3</span>batchEvictionSize: 10<span id="CO7-4"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">4</span>batchEvictionInterval: "1m0s"<span id="CO7-5"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">5</span>...
    ```
    
    Note
    You can configure live migration limits and timeouts by editing the `    spec.liveMigrationConfig` stanza of the `    HyperConverged` CR.
    
    
    
    
1. To apply your changes, save and exit the editor.
