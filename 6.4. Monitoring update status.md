## 6.4. Monitoring update status




### 6.4.1. Monitoring OpenShift Virtualization upgrade status




To monitor the status of a OpenShift Virtualization Operator upgrade, watch the cluster service version (CSV) `PHASE` . You can also monitor the CSV conditions in the web console or by running the command provided here.

Note
The `PHASE` and conditions values are approximations that are based on available information.



 **Prerequisites** 

- Log in to the cluster as a user with the `    cluster-admin` role.
- Install the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).


 **Procedure** 

1. Run the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc get csv -n openshift-cnv
    ```
    
    
1. Review the output, checking the `    PHASE` field. For example:
    
     **Example output** 
    
    
    ```
    VERSION  REPLACES                                        PHASE    4.9.0    kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v4.8.2         Installing    4.9.0    kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v4.9.0         Replacing
    ```
    
    
    
1. Optional: Monitor the aggregated status of all OpenShift Virtualization component conditions by running the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc get hco -n openshift-cnv kubevirt-hyperconverged \    -o=jsonpath='{range .status.conditions[*]}{.type}{"\t"}{.status}{"\t"}{.message}{"\n"}{end}'
    ```
    
    A successful upgrade results in the following output:
    
     **Example output** 
    
    
    ```
    ReconcileComplete  True  Reconcile completed successfully    Available          True  Reconcile completed successfully    Progressing        False Reconcile completed successfully    Degraded           False Reconcile completed successfully    Upgradeable        True  Reconcile completed successfully
    ```
    
    
    


### 6.4.2. Viewing outdated OpenShift Virtualization workloads




You can view a list of outdated workloads by using the CLI.

Note
If there are outdated virtualization pods in your cluster, the `OutdatedVirtualMachineInstanceWorkloads` alert fires.



 **Procedure** 

- To view a list of outdated virtual machine instances (VMIs), run the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc get vmi -l kubevirt.io/outdatedLauncherImage --all-namespaces
    ```
    
    


Note
 [Configure workload updates](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#configuring-workload-updates_upgrading-virt) to ensure that VMIs update automatically.
