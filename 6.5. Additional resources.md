# Chapter 7. Security policies




Virtual machine (VM) workloads run as unprivileged pods. So that VMs can use OpenShift Virtualization features, some pods are granted custom security policies that are not available to other pod owners:

- An extended `    container_t` SELinux policy applies to `    virt-launcher` pods.
-  [Security context constraints](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/authentication_and_authorization/#security-context-constraints-about_configuring-internal-oauth) (SCCs) are defined for the `    kubevirt-controller` service account.
