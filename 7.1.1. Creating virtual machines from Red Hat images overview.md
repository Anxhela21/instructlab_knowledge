## 7.1.1. Creating virtual machines from Red Hat images overview

Red Hat images are golden images. They are published as container disks in a secure registry. The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) polls and imports the container disks into your cluster and stores them in the openshift-virtualization-os-images project as snapshots or persistent volume claims (PVCs).

Red Hat images are automatically updated. You can disable and re-enable automatic updates for these images. See Managing Red Hat boot source updates .

Cluster administrators can enable automatic subscription for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual machines in the OpenShift Virtualization web console.

You can create virtual machines (VMs) from operating system images provided by Red Hat by using one of the following methods:

- Creating a VM from a template by using the web console
- Creating a VM from an instance type by using the web console
- Creating a VM from a VirtualMachine manifest by using the command line
