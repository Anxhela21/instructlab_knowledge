## 7.1.1.1.1. How do golden images work?

Golden images are created by installing and configuring an operating system and software applications on a reference machine or virtual machine. This includes setting up the system, installing required drivers, applying patches and updates, and configuring specific options and preferences.

After the golden image is created, it is saved as a template or image file that can be replicated and deployed across multiple clusters. The golden image can be updated by its maintainer periodically to incorporate necessary software updates and patches, ensuring that the image remains up to date and secure, and newly created VMs are based on this updated image.
