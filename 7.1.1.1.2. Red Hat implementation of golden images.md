## 7.1.1.1.2. Red Hat implementation of golden images

Red Hat publishes golden images as container disks in the registry for versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Container disks are virtual machine images that are stored as a container image in a container image registry. Any published image will automatically be made available in connected clusters

after the installation of OpenShift Virtualization. After the images are available in a cluster, they are ready to use to create VMs.
