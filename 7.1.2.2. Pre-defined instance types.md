## 7.1.2.2. Pre-defined instance types

OpenShift Virtualization includes a set of pre-defined instance types called common-instancetypes . Some are specialized for specific workloads and others are workload-agnostic.

These instance type resources are named according to their series, version, and size. The size value follows the . delimiter and ranges from nano to 8xlarge .
