## 7.10. MANAGING VIRTUAL MACHINE INSTANCES

If you have standalone virtual machine instances (VMIs) that were created independently outside of the OpenShift Virtualization environment, you can manage them by using the web console or by using oc or virtctl commands from the command-line interface (CLI).

The virtctl command provides more virtualization options than the oc command. For example, you can use virtctl to pause a VM or expose a port.
