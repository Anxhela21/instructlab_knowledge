## 7.13. MANAGING VIRTUAL MACHINES WITH OPENSHIFT PIPELINES

Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines is a Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework that allows developers to design and run each step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container.

By using OpenShift Pipelines tasks and the example pipeline, you can do the following:

- Create and manage virtual machines (VMs), persistent volume claims (PVCs), data volumes, and data sources.
- Run commands in VMs.
- Manipulate disk images with libguestfs tools.

The tasks are located in the task catalog (ArtifactHub).

The example Windows pipeline is located in the pipeline catalog (ArtifactHub).
