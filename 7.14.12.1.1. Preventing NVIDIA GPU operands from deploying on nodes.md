## 7.14.12.1.1. Preventing NVIDIA GPU operands from deploying on nodes

If you use the NVIDIA GPU Operator in your cluster, you can apply the nvidia.com/gpu.deploy.operands=false label to nodes that you do not want to configure for GPU or vGPU operands. This label prevents the creation of the pods that configure GPU or vGPU operands and terminates the pods if they already exist.
