## 7.14.13.1. About using virtual GPUs with OpenShift Virtualization

OpenShift Virtualization can automatically create vGPUs and other mediated devices if an administrator provides configuration details in the HyperConverged custom resource (CR). This automation is especially useful for large clusters.
