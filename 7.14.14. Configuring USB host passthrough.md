## 7.14.14. Configuring USB host passthrough

As a cluster administrator, you can expose USB devices in a cluster, making them available for virtual machine (VM) owners to assign to VMs. Enabling this passthrough of USB devices allows a guest to connect to actual USB hardware that is attached to an OpenShift Container Platform node, as if the hardware and the VM are physically connected.

You can expose a USB device by first enabling host passthrough and then configuring the VM to use the USB device.
