## 7.14.18.1. Overcommitting CPU resources

Time-slicing allows multiple virtual CPUs (vCPUs) to share a single physical CPU. This is known as CPU overcommitment . Guaranteed VMs can not be overcommitted.

Configure CPU overcommitment to prioritize VM density over performance when assigning CPUs to VMs. With a higher CPU over-commitment of vCPUs, more VMs fit onto a given node.
