## 7.14.18.2. Setting the CPU allocation ratio

The CPU Allocation Ratio specifies the degree of overcommitment by mapping vCPUs to time slices of physical CPUs.

For example, a mapping or ratio of 10:1 maps 10 virtual CPUs to 1 physical CPU by using time slices.

To change the default number of vCPUs mapped to each physical CPU, set the vmiCPUAllocationRatio value in the HyperConverged CR. The pod CPU request is calculated by multiplying the number of vCPUs by the reciprocal of the CPU allocation ratio. For example, if vmiCPUAllocationRatio is set to 10, OpenShift Virtualization will request 10 times fewer CPUs on the pod for that VM.
