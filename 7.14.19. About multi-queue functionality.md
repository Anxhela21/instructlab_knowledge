## 7.14.19. About multi-queue functionality

Use multi-queue functionality to scale network throughput and performance on virtual machines (VMs) with multiple vCPUs.

By default, the queueCount value, which is derived from the domain XML, is determined by the number of vCPUs allocated to a VM. Network performance does not scale as the number of vCPUs increases. Additionally, because virtio-net has only one Tx and Rx queue, guests cannot transmit or retrieve packs in parallel.
