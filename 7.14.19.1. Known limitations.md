## 7.14.19.1. Known limitations

- MSI vectors are still consumed if virtio-net multiqueue is enabled in the host but not enabled in the guest operating system by the administrator.
- Each virtio-net queue consumes 64 KiB of kernel memory for the vhost driver.
- Starting a VM with more than 16 CPUs results in no connectivity if networkInterfaceMultiqueue is set to 'true' (CNV-16107).
