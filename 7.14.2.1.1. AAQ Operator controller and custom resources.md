## 7.14.2.1.1. AAQ Operator controller and custom resources

The AAQ Operator introduces two new API objects defined as custom resource definitions (CRDs) for managing alternative quota implementations across multiple namespaces:

- ApplicationAwareResourceQuota : Sets aggregate quota restrictions enforced per namespace. The ApplicationAwareResourceQuota API is compatible with the native ResourceQuota object and shares the same specification and status definitions.
