## 7.14.3.2.2. Example: VM node placement with pod affinity and pod anti-affinity

In this example, the VM must be scheduled on a node that has a running pod with the label examplekey-1 = example-value-1 . If there is no such pod running on any node, the VM is not scheduled.

If possible, the VM is not scheduled on a node that has any pod with the label example-key-2 = example-value-2 . However, if all candidate nodes have a pod with this label, the scheduler ignores this constraint.
