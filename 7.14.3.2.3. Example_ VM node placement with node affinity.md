## 7.14.3.2.3. Example: VM node placement with node affinity

In this example, the VM must be scheduled on a node that has the label example.io/example-key = example-value-1 or the label example.io/example-key = example-value-2 . The constraint is met if only one of the labels is present on the node. If neither label is present, the VM is not scheduled.

If possible, the scheduler avoids nodes that have the label example-node-label-key = example-nodelabel-value . However, if all candidate nodes have this label, the scheduler ignores this constraint.
