## 7.14.5.2. Troubleshooting certificate rotation parameters

Deleting one or more certConfig values causes them to revert to the default values, unless the default values conflict with one of the following conditions:

- The value of ca.renewBefore must be less than or equal to the value of ca.duration .
- The value of server.duration must be less than or equal to the value of ca.duration .
- The value of server.renewBefore must be less than or equal to the value of server.duration .

If the default values conflict with these conditions, you will receive an error.

If you remove the server.duration value in the following example, the default value of 24h0m0s is greater than the value of ca.duration , conflicting with the specified conditions.
