## 7.14.6. Configuring the default CPU model

Use the defaultCPUModel setting in the HyperConverged custom resource (CR) to define a clusterwide default CPU model.

The virtual machine (VM) CPU model depends on the availability of CPU models within the VM and the cluster.

- If the VM does not have a defined CPU model:
- The defaultCPUModel is automatically set using the CPU model defined at the clusterwide level.
- If both the VM and the cluster have a defined CPU model:
- The VM's CPU model takes precedence.
- If neither the VM nor the cluster have a defined CPU model:
- The host-model is automatically set using the CPU model defined at the host level.
