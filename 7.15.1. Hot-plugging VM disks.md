## 7.15.1. Hot-plugging VM disks

You can add or remove virtual disks without stopping your virtual machine (VM) or virtual machine instance (VMI).

Only data volumes and persistent volume claims (PVCs) can be hot plugged and hot-unplugged. You cannot hot plug or hot-unplug container disks.

A hot plugged disk remains attached to the VM even after reboot. You must detach the disk to remove it from the VM.

You can make a hot plugged disk persistent so that it is permanently mounted on the VM.
