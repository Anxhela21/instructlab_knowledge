## 7.15.1.1. Hot plugging and hot unplugging a disk by using the web console

You can hot plug a disk by attaching it to a virtual machine (VM) while the VM is running by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

The hot plugged disk remains attached to the VM until you unplug it.

You can make a hot plugged disk persistent so that it is permanently mounted on the VM.
