## 7.15.2. Expanding virtual machine disks

You can increase the size of a virtual machine (VM) disk by expanding the persistent volume claim (PVC) of the disk.

If your storage provider does not support volume expansion, you can expand the available virtual storage of a VM by adding blank data volumes.

You cannot reduce the size of a VM disk.
