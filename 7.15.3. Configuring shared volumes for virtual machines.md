## 7.15.3. Configuring shared volumes for virtual machines

You can configure shared disks to allow multiple virtual machines (VMs) to share the same underlying storage. A shared disk's volume must be block mode.

You configure disk sharing by exposing the storage as either of these types:

- An ordinary VM disk
- A logical unit number (LUN) disk with an SCSI connection and raw device mapping, as required for Windows Failover Clustering for shared volumes

In addition to configuring disk sharing, you can also set an error policy for each ordinary VM disk or LUN

In addition to configuring disk sharing, you can also set an error policy for each ordinary VM disk or LUN disk. The error policy controls how the hypervisor behaves when an input/output error occurs on a disk Read or Write.
