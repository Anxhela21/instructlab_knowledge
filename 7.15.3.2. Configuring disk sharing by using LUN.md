## 7.15.3.2. Configuring disk sharing by using LUN

To secure data on your VM from outside access, you can enable SCSI persistent reservation and configure a LUN-backed virtual machine disk to be shared among multiple virtual machines. By enabling the shared option, you can use advanced SCSI commands, such as those required for a Windows failover clustering implementation, for managing the underlying storage.

When a storage volume is configured as the LUN disk type, a VM can use the volume as a logical unit number (LUN) device. As a result, the VM can deploy and manage the disk by using SCSI commands.

You reserve a LUN through the SCSI persistent reserve options. To enable the reservation:

- 1. Configure the feature gate option
- 2.  Activate the feature gate option on the LUN disk to issue SCSI device-specific input and output controls (IOCTLs) that the VM requires.

You can set an error policy for each LUN disk. The error policy controls how the hypervisor behaves when an input/output error occurs on a disk Read or Write. The default behavior stops the guest and generates a Kubernetes event.

For a LUN disk with an SCSi connection and a persistent reservation, as required for Windows Failover Clustering for shared volumes, you set the error policy to report .
