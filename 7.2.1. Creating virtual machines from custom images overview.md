## 7.2.1. Creating virtual machines from custom images overview

You can create virtual machines (VMs) from custom operating system images by using one of the following methods:

- Importing the image as a container disk from a registry . Optional: You can enable auto updates for your container disks. See Managing automatic boot source updates for details.
- Importing the image from a web page .
- Uploading the image from a local machine .
- Cloning a persistent volume claim (PVC) that contains the image .

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) imports the image into a PVC by using a data volume. You add the PVC to the VM by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console or command line.
