## 7.2.5. Installing the QEMU guest agent and VirtIO drivers

The QEMU guest agent is a daemon that runs on the virtual machine (VM) and passes information to the host about the VM, users, file systems, and secondary networks.

You must install the QEMU guest agent on VMs created from operating system images that are not provided by Red Hat.
