## 7.2.7.1. About cloning

When cloning a data volume, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) chooses one of the following Container Storage Interface (CSI) clone methods:

- CSI volume cloning
- Smart cloning

Both CSI volume cloning and smart cloning methods are efficient, but they have certain requirements for use. If the requirements are not met, the CDI uses host-assisted cloning. Host-assisted cloning is the slowest and least efficient method of cloning, but it has fewer requirements than either of the other two cloning methods.
