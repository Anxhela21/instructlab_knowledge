## 7.2.7.1.1. CSI volume cloning

Container Storage Interface (CSI) cloning uses CSI driver features to more efficiently clone a source data volume.

CSI volume cloning has the following requirements:

- The CSI driver that backs the storage class of the persistent volume claim (PVC) must support volume cloning.
- For provisioners not recognized by the CDI, the corresponding storage profile must have the cloneStrategy set to CSI Volume Cloning.
- The source and target PVCs must have the same storage class and volume mode.

- If you create the data volume, you must have permission to create the datavolumes/source resource in the source namespace.
- The source volume must not be in use.
