## 7.2.7.1.2. Smart cloning

When a Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin with snapshot capabilities is available, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) creates a persistent volume claim (PVC) from a snapshot, which then allows efficient cloning of additional PVCs.

Smart cloning has the following requirements:

- A snapshot class associated with the storage class must exist.
- The source and target PVCs must have the same storage class and volume mode.
- If you create the data volume, you must have permission to create the datavolumes/source resource in the source namespace.
- The source volume must not be in use.
