## 7.2.7.1.3. Host-assisted cloning

When the requirements for neither Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume cloning nor smart cloning have been met, host-assisted cloning is used as a fallback method. Host-assisted cloning is less efficient than either of the two other cloning methods.

Host-assisted cloning uses a source pod and a target pod to copy data from the source volume to the target volume. The target persistent volume claim (PVC) is annotated with the fallback reason that explains why host-assisted cloning has been used, and an event is created.
