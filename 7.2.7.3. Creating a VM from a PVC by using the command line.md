## 7.2.7.3. Creating a VM from a PVC by using the command line

You can create a virtual machine (VM) by cloning the persistent volume claim (PVC) of an existing VM by using the command line.

You can clone a PVC by using one of the following options:

- Cloning a PVC to a new data volume. This method creates a data volume whose lifecycle is independent of the original VM. Deleting the original VM does not affect the new data volume or its associated PVC.
- Cloning a PVC by creating a VirtualMachine manifest with a dataVolumeTemplates stanza. This method creates a data volume whose lifecycle is dependent on the original VM. Deleting the original VM deletes the cloned data volume and its associated PVC.
