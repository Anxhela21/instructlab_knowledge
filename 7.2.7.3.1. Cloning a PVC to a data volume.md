You create a data volume that references the original source PVC. The lifecycle of the new data volume is independent of the original VM. Deleting the original VM does not affect the new data volume or its associated PVC.

Cloning between different volume modes is supported for host-assisted cloning, such as cloning from a

Cloning between different volume modes is supported for host-assisted cloning, such as cloning from a block persistent volume (PV) to a file system PV, as long as the source and target PVs belong to the kubevirt content type.
