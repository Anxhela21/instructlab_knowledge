## 7.2.7.3.2. Creating a VM from a cloned PVC by using a data volume template

You can create a virtual machine (VM) that clones the persistent volume claim (PVC) of an existing VM by using a data volume template.

This method creates a data volume whose lifecycle is dependent on the original VM. Deleting the original VM deletes the cloned data volume and its associated PVC.
