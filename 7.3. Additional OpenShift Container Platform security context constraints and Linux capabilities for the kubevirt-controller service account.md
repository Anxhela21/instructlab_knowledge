## 7.3. Additional OpenShift Container Platform security context constraints and Linux capabilities for the kubevirt-controller service account




Security context constraints (SCCs) control permissions for pods. These permissions include actions that a pod, a collection of containers, can perform and what resources it can access. You can use SCCs to define a set of conditions that a pod must run with to be accepted into the system.

The `virt-controller` is a cluster controller that creates the `virt-launcher` pods for virtual machines in the cluster. These pods are granted permissions by the `kubevirt-controller` service account.

The `kubevirt-controller` service account is granted additional SCCs and Linux capabilities so that it can create `virt-launcher` pods with the appropriate permissions. These extended permissions allow virtual machines to use OpenShift Virtualization features that are beyond the scope of typical pods.

The `kubevirt-controller` service account is granted the following SCCs:

-  `    scc.AllowHostDirVolumePlugin = true`     
This allows virtual machines to use the hostpath volume plugin.
-  `    scc.AllowPrivilegedContainer = false`     
This ensures the virt-launcher pod is not run as a privileged container.
-  `    scc.AllowedCapabilities = []corev1.Capability{"SYS_NICE", "NET_BIND_SERVICE", "SYS_PTRACE"}`     

    
    
    -  `        SYS_NICE` allows setting the CPU affinity.
    -  `        NET_BIND_SERVICE` allows DHCP and Slirp operations.
    -  `        SYS_PTRACE` enables certain versions of `        libvirt` to find the process ID (PID) of `        swtpm` , a software Trusted Platform Module (TPM) emulator.
    


### 7.3.1. Viewing the SCC and RBAC definitions for the kubevirt-controller




You can view the `SecurityContextConstraints` definition for the `kubevirt-controller` by using the `oc` tool:

```
$ oc get scc kubevirt-controller -o yaml
```

You can view the RBAC definition for the `kubevirt-controller` clusterrole by using the `oc` tool:

```
$ oc get clusterrole kubevirt-controller -o yaml
```
