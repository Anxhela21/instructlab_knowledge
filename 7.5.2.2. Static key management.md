## 7.5.2.2. Static key management

You can add a statically managed public SSH key when you create a virtual machine (VM) by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line. The key is added as a cloud-init data source when the VM boots for the first time.

You can also add a public SSH key to a project when you create a VM by using the web console. The key is saved as a secret and is added automatically to all VMs that you create.
