## 7.5.2.2.1. Adding a key when creating a VM from a template

You can add a statically managed public SSH key when you create a virtual machine (VM) by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. The key is added to the VM as a cloud-init data source at first boot. This method does not affect cloud-init user data.

Optional: You can add a key to a project. Afterwards, this key is added automatically to VMs that you create in the project.
