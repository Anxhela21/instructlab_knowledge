## 7.5.2.2.2. Adding a key when creating a VM from an instance type by using the web console

You can create a virtual machine (VM) from an instance type by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. You can also use the web console to create a VM by copying an existing snapshot or to clone a VM.

You can create a VM from a list of available bootable volumes. You can add Linux- or Windows-based volumes to the list.

You can add a statically managed SSH key when you create a virtual machine (VM) from an instance type by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. The key is added to the VM as a cloud-init data source at first boot. This method does not affect cloud-init user data.
