## 7.5.2.2.3. Adding a key when creating a VM by using the command line

You can add a statically managed public SSH key when you create a virtual machine (VM) by using the command line. The key is added to the VM at first boot.

The key is added to the VM as a cloud-init data source. This method separates the access credentials from the application data in the cloud-init user data. This method does not affect cloud-init user data.
