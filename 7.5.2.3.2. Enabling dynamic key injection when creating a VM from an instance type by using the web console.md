You can create a virtual machine (VM) from an instance type by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. You can also use the web console to create a VM by copying an existing snapshot or to clone a VM.

You can create a VM from a list of available bootable volumes. You can add Linux- or Windows-based volumes to the list.

You can enable dynamic SSH key injection when you create a virtual machine (VM) from an instance type by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. Then, you can add or revoke the key at runtime.
