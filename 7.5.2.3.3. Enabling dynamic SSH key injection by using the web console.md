## 7.5.2.3.3. Enabling dynamic SSH key injection by using the web console

You can enable dynamic key injection for a virtual machine (VM) by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. Then, you can update the public SSH key at runtime.

The key is added to the VM by the QEMU guest agent, which is installed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.
