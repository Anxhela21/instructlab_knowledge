## 7.6.6. Adding a secret, config map, or service account to a virtual machine

You add a secret, config map, or service account to a virtual machine by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

These resources are added to the virtual machine as disks. You then mount the secret, config map, or service account as you would mount any other disk.

If the virtual machine is running, changes do not take effect until you restart the virtual machine. The newly added resources are marked as pending changes at the top of the page.
