## 7.7. EDITING BOOT ORDER

You can update the values for a boot order list by using the web console or the CLI.

With Boot Order in the Virtual Machine Overview page, you can:

- Select a disk or network interface controller (NIC) and add it to the boot order list.
- Edit the order of the disks or NICs in the boot order list.
- Remove a disk or NIC from the boot order list, and return it back to the inventory of bootable sources.
