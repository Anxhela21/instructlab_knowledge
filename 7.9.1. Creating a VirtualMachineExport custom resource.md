## 7.9.1. Creating a VirtualMachineExport custom resource

You can create a VirtualMachineExport custom resource (CR) to export the following objects:

- Virtual machine (VM): Exports the persistent volume claims (PVCs) of a specified VM.
- VM snapshot: Exports PVCs contained in a VirtualMachineSnapshot CR.
- PVC: Exports a PVC. If the PVC is used by another pod, such as the virt-launcher pod, the export remains in a Pending state until the PVC is no longer in use.

The VirtualMachineExport CR creates internal and external links for the exported volumes. Internal links are valid within the cluster. External links can be accessed by using an Ingress or Route .

The export server supports the following file formats:

- raw : Raw disk image file.
- gzip : Compressed disk image file.
- dir : PVC directory and files.
- tar.gz : Compressed PVC file.
