## 8.2.1. Configuring masquerade mode from the command line

You can use masquerade mode to hide a virtual machine's outgoing traffic behind the pod IP address. Masquerade mode uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to connect virtual machines to the pod network backend through a Linux bridge.

Enable masquerade mode and allow traffic to enter the virtual machine by editing your virtual machine configuration file.
