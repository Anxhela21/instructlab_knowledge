## 8.4. ACCESSING A VIRTUAL MACHINE BY USING ITS INTERNAL FQDN

You can access a virtual machine (VM) that is connected to the default internal pod network on a stable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) by using headless services.

A Kubernetes headless service is a form of service that does not allocate a cluster IP address to represent a set of pods. Instead of providing a single virtual IP address for the service, a headless service creates a DNS record for each pod associated with the service. You can expose a VM through its FQDN without having to expose a specific TCP or UDP port.
