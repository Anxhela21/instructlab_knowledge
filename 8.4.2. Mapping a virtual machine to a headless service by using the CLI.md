## 8.4.2. Mapping a virtual machine to a headless service by using the CLI

To connect to a virtual machine (VM) from within the cluster by using its internal fully qualified domain

To connect to a virtual machine (VM) from within the cluster by using its internal fully qualified domain name (FQDN), you must first map the VM to a headless service. Set the spec.hostname and spec.subdomain parameters in the VM configuration file.

If a headless service exists with a name that matches the subdomain, a unique DNS A record is created for the VM in the form of <vm.spec.hostname>.<vm.spec.subdomain>. <vm.metadata.namespace>.svc.cluster.local .
