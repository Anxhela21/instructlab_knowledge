## 8.5. CONNECTING A VIRTUAL MACHINE TO A LINUX BRIDGE NETWORK

By default, OpenShift Virtualization is installed with a single, internal pod network.

You can create a Linux bridge network and attach a virtual machine (VM) to the network by performing the following steps:

- 1. Create a Linux bridge node network configuration policy (NNCP) .
- 2.  Create a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) by using the web console or the command line.
- 3.  Configure the VM to recognize the NAD by using the web console or the command line.
