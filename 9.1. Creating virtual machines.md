## 9.1. Creating virtual machines




Use one of these procedures to create a virtual machine:

- Quick Start guided tour
- Quick create from the **Catalog** 
- Pasting a pre-configured YAML file with the virtual machine wizard
- Using the CLI


Warning
Do not create virtual machines in `openshift-*` namespaces. Instead, create a new namespace or use an existing namespace without the `openshift` prefix.



When you create virtual machines from the web console, select a virtual machine template that is configured with a boot source. Virtual machine templates with a boot source are labeled as **Available boot source** or they display a customized label text. Using templates with an available boot source expedites the process of creating virtual machines.

Templates without a boot source are labeled as **Boot source required** . You can use these templates if you complete the steps for [adding a boot source to the virtual machine](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-adding-a-boot-source-web_virt-creating-vm-template) .

Important
Due to differences in storage behavior, some virtual machine templates are incompatible with single-node OpenShift. To ensure compatibility, do not set the `evictionStrategy` field for any templates or virtual machines that use data volumes or storage profiles.



### 9.1.1. Using a Quick Start to create a virtual machine




The web console provides Quick Starts with instructional guided tours for creating virtual machines. You can access the Quick Starts catalog by selecting the Help menu in the **Administrator** perspective to view the Quick Starts catalog. When you click on a Quick Start tile and begin the tour, the system guides you through the process.

Tasks in a Quick Start begin with selecting a Red Hat template. Then, you can add a boot source and import the operating system image. Finally, you can save the custom template and use it to create a virtual machine.

 **Prerequisites** 

- Access to the website where you can download the URL link for the operating system image.


 **Procedure** 

1. In the web console, select **Quick Starts** from the Help menu.
1. Click on a tile in the Quick Starts catalog. For example: **Creating a Red Hat Linux Enterprise Linux virtual machine** .
1. Follow the instructions in the guided tour and complete the tasks for importing an operating system image and creating a virtual machine. The **Virtualization** → **VirtualMachines** page displays the virtual machine.


### 9.1.2. Quick creating a virtual machine




You can quickly create a virtual machine (VM) by using a template with an available boot source.

 **Procedure** 

1. Click **Virtualization** → **Catalog** in the side menu.
1. Click **Boot source available** to filter templates with boot sources.
    
    Note
    By default, the template list will show only **Default Templates** . Click **All Items** when filtering to see all available templates for your chosen filters.
    
    
    
    
1. Click a template to view its details.
1. Click **Quick Create VirtualMachine** to create a VM from the template.
    
    The virtual machine **Details** page is displayed with the provisioning status.
    
    


 **Verification** 

1. Click **Events** to view a stream of events as the VM is provisioned.
1. Click **Console** to verify that the VM booted successfully.


### 9.1.3. Creating a virtual machine from a customized template




Some templates require additional parameters, for example, a PVC with a boot source. You can customize select parameters of a template to create a virtual machine (VM).

 **Procedure** 

1. In the web console, select a template:
    
    
    1. Click **Virtualization** → **Catalog** in the side menu.
    1. Optional: Filter the templates by project, keyword, operating system, or workload profile.
    1. Click the template that you want to customize.
    
1. Click **Customize VirtualMachine** .
1. Specify parameters for your VM, including its **Name** and **Disk source** . You can optionally specify a data source to clone.


 **Verification** 

1. Click **Events** to view a stream of events as the VM is provisioned.
1. Click **Console** to verify that the VM booted successfully.


Refer to the virtual machine fields section when creating a VM from the web console.

<span id="virt-storage-wizard-fields-advanced-web_virt-create-vms"></span>
###### Advanced storage settings


The following advanced storage settings are optional and available for **Blank** , **Import via URL** , and **Clone existing PVC** disks. Before OpenShift Virtualization 4.11, if you do not specify these parameters, the system uses the default values from the `kubevirt-storage-class-defaults` config map. In OpenShift Virtualization 4.11 and later, the system uses the default values from the [storage profile](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-customizing-storage-profile_virt-creating-data-volumes) .

Note
Use storage profiles to ensure consistent advanced storage settings when provisioning storage for OpenShift Virtualization.

To manually specify **Volume Mode** and **Access Mode** , you must clear the **Apply optimized StorageProfile settings** checkbox, which is selected by default.



| Name | Mode description | Parameter | Parameter description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Volume Mode | Defines whether the persistent volume uses a formatted file system or raw block state. Default is **Filesystem** . | Filesystem | Stores the virtual disk on a file system-based volume. |
| Block | Stores the virtual disk directly on the block volume. Only use `Block` if the underlying storage supports it. |
| Access Mode | Access mode of the persistent volume. | ReadWriteOnce (RWO) | Volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. |
| ReadWriteMany (RWX) | Volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes at one time.

Note
This is required for some features, such as live migration of virtual machines between nodes. |
| ReadOnlyMany (ROX) | Volume can be mounted as read only by many nodes. |


#### 9.1.3.3. Cloud-init fields




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Hostname | Sets a specific hostname for the virtual machine. |
| Authorized SSH Keys | The user’s public key that is copied to ** _~/.ssh/authorized_keys_ ** on the virtual machine. |
| Custom script | Replaces other options with a field in which you paste a custom cloud-init script. |


To configure storage class defaults, use storage profiles. For more information, see [Customizing the storage profile](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-customizing-storage-profile_virt-creating-data-volumes) .

#### 9.1.3.4. Pasting in a pre-configured YAML file to create a virtual machine




Create a virtual machine by writing or pasting a YAML configuration file. A valid `example` virtual machine configuration is provided by default whenever you open the YAML edit screen.

If your YAML configuration is invalid when you click **Create** , an error message indicates the parameter in which the error occurs. Only one error is shown at a time.

Note
Navigating away from the YAML screen while editing cancels any changes to the configuration you have made.



 **Procedure** 

1. Click **Virtualization** → **VirtualMachines** from the side menu.
1. Click **Create** and select **With YAML** .
1. Write or paste your virtual machine configuration in the editable window.
    
    
    1. Alternatively, use the `        example` virtual machine provided by default in the YAML screen.
    
1. Optional: Click **Download** to download the YAML configuration file in its present state.
1. Click **Create** to create the virtual machine.


The virtual machine is listed on the **VirtualMachines** page.

### 9.1.4. Using the CLI to create a virtual machine




You can create a virtual machine from a `virtualMachine` manifest.

 **Procedure** 

1. Edit the `    VirtualMachine` manifest for your VM. For example, the following manifest configures a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM:
    
    
    <span id="idm139667240482464"></span>
     **Example 9.1. Example manifest for a RHEL VM** 
    
    
    ```

    ```
    
    
    
    

1. Create a virtual machine by using the manifest file:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc create -f &lt;vm_manifest_file&gt;.yaml
    ```
    
    
1. Optional: Start the virtual machine:
    
    
    ```
    $ virtctl start &lt;vm_name&gt;
    ```
    
    


### 9.1.5. Virtual machine storage volume types




| Storage volume type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ephemeral | A local copy-on-write (COW) image that uses a network volume as a read-only backing store. The backing volume must be a **PersistentVolumeClaim** . The ephemeral image is created when the virtual machine starts and stores all writes locally. The ephemeral image is discarded when the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or deleted. The backing volume (PVC) is not mutated in any way. |
| persistentVolumeClaim | Attaches an available PV to a virtual machine. Attaching a PV allows for the virtual machine data to persist between sessions.

Importing an existing virtual machine disk into a PVC by using CDI and attaching the PVC to a virtual machine instance is the recommended method for importing existing virtual machines into OpenShift Container Platform. There are some requirements for the disk to be used within a PVC. |
| dataVolume | Data volumes build on the `persistentVolumeClaim` disk type by managing the process of preparing the virtual machine disk via an import, clone, or upload operation. VMs that use this volume type are guaranteed not to start until the volume is ready.

Specify `type: dataVolume` or `type: ""` . If you specify any other value for `type` , such as `persistentVolumeClaim` , a warning is displayed, and the virtual machine does not start. |
| cloudInitNoCloud | Attaches a disk that contains the referenced cloud-init NoCloud data source, providing user data and metadata to the virtual machine. A cloud-init installation is required inside the virtual machine disk. |
| containerDisk | References an image, such as a virtual machine disk, that is stored in the container image registry. The image is pulled from the registry and attached to the virtual machine as a disk when the virtual machine is launched.

A `containerDisk` volume is not limited to a single virtual machine and is useful for creating large numbers of virtual machine clones that do not require persistent storage.

Only RAW and QCOW2 formats are supported disk types for the container image registry. QCOW2 is recommended for reduced image size.

Note
A `containerDisk` volume is ephemeral. It is discarded when the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or deleted. A `containerDisk` volume is useful for read-only file systems such as CD-ROMs or for disposable virtual machines. |
| emptyDisk | Creates an additional sparse QCOW2 disk that is tied to the life-cycle of the virtual machine interface. The data survives guest-initiated reboots in the virtual machine but is discarded when the virtual machine stops or is restarted from the web console. The empty disk is used to store application dependencies and data that otherwise exceeds the limited temporary file system of an ephemeral disk.

The disk **capacity** size must also be provided. |


### 9.1.6. About RunStrategies for virtual machines




A `RunStrategy` for virtual machines determines a virtual machine instance’s (VMI) behavior, depending on a series of conditions. The `spec.runStrategy` setting exists in the virtual machine configuration process as an alternative to the `spec.running` setting. The `spec.runStrategy` setting allows greater flexibility for how VMIs are created and managed, in contrast to the `spec.running` setting with only `true` or `false` responses. However, the two settings are mutually exclusive. Only either `spec.running` or `spec.runStrategy` can be used. An error occurs if both are used.

There are four defined RunStrategies.

Different combinations of the `start` , `stop` and `restart` virtctl commands affect which `RunStrategy` is used.

The following table follows a VM’s transition from different states. The first column shows the VM’s initial `RunStrategy` . Each additional column shows a virtctl command and the new `RunStrategy` after that command is run.

| Initial RunStrategy | start | stop | restart |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Always | - | Halted | Always |
| RerunOnFailure | - | Halted | RerunOnFailure |
| Manual | Manual | Manual | Manual |
| Halted | Always | - | - |


Note
In OpenShift Virtualization clusters installed using installer-provisioned infrastructure, when a node fails the MachineHealthCheck and becomes unavailable to the cluster, VMs with a RunStrategy of `Always` or `RerunOnFailure` are rescheduled on a new node.
