## 9.13. Installing VirtIO driver on an existing Windows virtual machine




### 9.13.1. About VirtIO drivers




VirtIO drivers are paravirtualized device drivers required for Microsoft Windows virtual machines to run in OpenShift Virtualization. The supported drivers are available in the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk of the [Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/container-native-virtualization/virtio-win) .

The `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk must be attached to the virtual machine as a SATA CD drive to enable driver installation. You can install VirtIO drivers during Windows installation on the virtual machine or added to an existing Windows installation.

After the drivers are installed, the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk can be removed from the virtual machine.

 **Table 9.3. Supported drivers** 

| Driver name | Hardware ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  **viostor** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1001    
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1042 | The block driver. Sometimes displays as an **SCSI Controller** in the **Other devices** group. |
|  **viorng** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1005    
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1044 | The entropy source driver. Sometimes displays as a **PCI Device** in the **Other devices** group. |
|  **NetKVM** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1000    
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1041 | The network driver. Sometimes displays as an **Ethernet Controller** in the **Other devices** group. Available only if a VirtIO NIC is configured. |




### 9.13.3. Adding VirtIO drivers container disk to a virtual machine




OpenShift Virtualization distributes VirtIO drivers for Microsoft Windows as a container disk, which is available from the [Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/container-native-virtualization/virtio-win) . To install these drivers to a Windows virtual machine, attach the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk to the virtual machine as a SATA CD drive in the virtual machine configuration file.

 **Prerequisites** 

- Download the `    container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk from the [Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/container-native-virtualization/virtio-win) . This is not mandatory, because the container disk will be downloaded from the Red Hat registry if it not already present in the cluster, but it can reduce installation time.


 **Procedure** 

1. Add the `    container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk as a `    cdrom` disk in the Windows virtual machine configuration file. The container disk will be downloaded from the registry if it is not already present in the cluster.
    
    
    ```
    spec:      domain:        devices:          disks:            - name: virtiocontainerdisk              bootOrder: 2<span id="CO16-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>cdrom:                bus: sata    volumes:      - containerDisk:          image: container-native-virtualization/virtio-win        name: virtiocontainerdisk
    ```
    
    
1. The disk is available once the virtual machine has started:
    
    
    - If you add the container disk to a running virtual machine, use `        oc apply -f &lt;vm.yaml&gt;` in the CLI or reboot the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.
    - If the virtual machine is not running, use `        virtctl start &lt;vm&gt;` .
    


After the virtual machine has started, the VirtIO drivers can be installed from the attached SATA CD drive.

### 9.13.4. Installing VirtIO drivers on an existing Windows virtual machine




Install the VirtIO drivers from the attached SATA CD drive to an existing Windows virtual machine.

Note
This procedure uses a generic approach to adding drivers to Windows. The process might differ slightly between versions of Windows. See the installation documentation for your version of Windows for specific installation steps.



 **Procedure** 

1. Start the virtual machine and connect to a graphical console.
1. Log in to a Windows user session.
1. Open **Device Manager** and expand **Other devices** to list any **Unknown device** .
    
    
    1. Open the `        Device Properties` to identify the unknown device. Right-click the device and select **Properties** .
    1. Click the **Details** tab and select **Hardware Ids** in the **Property** list.
    1. Compare the **Value** for the **Hardware Ids** with the supported VirtIO drivers.
    
1. Right-click the device and select **Update Driver Software** .
1. Click **Browse my computer for driver software** and browse to the attached SATA CD drive, where the VirtIO drivers are located. The drivers are arranged hierarchically according to their driver type, operating system, and CPU architecture.
1. Click **Next** to install the driver.
1. Repeat this process for all the necessary VirtIO drivers.
1. After the driver installs, click **Close** to close the window.
1. Reboot the virtual machine to complete the driver installation.


### 9.13.5. Removing the VirtIO container disk from a virtual machine




After installing all required VirtIO drivers to the virtual machine, the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk no longer needs to be attached to the virtual machine. Remove the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk from the virtual machine configuration file.

 **Procedure** 

1. Edit the configuration file and remove the `    disk` and the `    volume` .
    
    
    ```
    $ oc edit vm &lt;vm-name&gt;
    ```
    
    
    ```
    spec:      domain:        devices:          disks:            - name: virtiocontainerdisk              bootOrder: 2              cdrom:                bus: sata    volumes:      - containerDisk:          image: container-native-virtualization/virtio-win        name: virtiocontainerdisk
    ```
    
    
1. Reboot the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.
