## 9.14. Installing VirtIO driver on a new Windows virtual machine




### 9.14.1. Prerequisites




- Windows installation media accessible by the virtual machine, such as [importing an ISO into a data volume](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-importing-vm-datavolume_virt-importing-virtual-machine-images-datavolumes) and attaching it to the virtual machine.


### 9.14.2. About VirtIO drivers




VirtIO drivers are paravirtualized device drivers required for Microsoft Windows virtual machines to run in OpenShift Virtualization. The supported drivers are available in the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk of the [Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/container-native-virtualization/virtio-win) .

The `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk must be attached to the virtual machine as a SATA CD drive to enable driver installation. You can install VirtIO drivers during Windows installation on the virtual machine or added to an existing Windows installation.

After the drivers are installed, the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk can be removed from the virtual machine.

| Driver name | Hardware ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  **viostor** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1001    
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1042 | The block driver. Sometimes displays as an **SCSI Controller** in the **Other devices** group. |
|  **viorng** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1005    
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1044 | The entropy source driver. Sometimes displays as a **PCI Device** in the **Other devices** group. |
|  **NetKVM** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1000    
VEN_1AF4&DEV_1041 | The network driver. Sometimes displays as an **Ethernet Controller** in the **Other devices** group. Available only if a VirtIO NIC is configured. |




### 9.14.4. Adding VirtIO drivers container disk to a virtual machine




OpenShift Virtualization distributes VirtIO drivers for Microsoft Windows as a container disk, which is available from the [Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/container-native-virtualization/virtio-win) . To install these drivers to a Windows virtual machine, attach the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk to the virtual machine as a SATA CD drive in the virtual machine configuration file.

 **Prerequisites** 

- Download the `    container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk from the [Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/container-native-virtualization/virtio-win) . This is not mandatory, because the container disk will be downloaded from the Red Hat registry if it not already present in the cluster, but it can reduce installation time.


 **Procedure** 

1. Add the `    container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk as a `    cdrom` disk in the Windows virtual machine configuration file. The container disk will be downloaded from the registry if it is not already present in the cluster.
    
    
    ```
    spec:      domain:        devices:          disks:            - name: virtiocontainerdisk              bootOrder: 2<span id="CO17-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>cdrom:                bus: sata    volumes:      - containerDisk:          image: container-native-virtualization/virtio-win        name: virtiocontainerdisk
    ```
    
    
1. The disk is available once the virtual machine has started:
    
    
    - If you add the container disk to a running virtual machine, use `        oc apply -f &lt;vm.yaml&gt;` in the CLI or reboot the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.
    - If the virtual machine is not running, use `        virtctl start &lt;vm&gt;` .
    


After the virtual machine has started, the VirtIO drivers can be installed from the attached SATA CD drive.

### 9.14.5. Installing VirtIO drivers during Windows installation




Install the VirtIO drivers from the attached SATA CD driver during Windows installation.

Note
This procedure uses a generic approach to the Windows installation and the installation method might differ between versions of Windows. See the documentation for the version of Windows that you are installing.



 **Procedure** 

1. Start the virtual machine and connect to a graphical console.
1. Begin the Windows installation process.
1. Select the **Advanced** installation.
1. The storage destination will not be recognized until the driver is loaded. Click `    Load driver` .
1. The drivers are attached as a SATA CD drive. Click **OK** and browse the CD drive for the storage driver to load. The drivers are arranged hierarchically according to their driver type, operating system, and CPU architecture.
1. Repeat the previous two steps for all required drivers.
1. Complete the Windows installation.


### 9.14.6. Removing the VirtIO container disk from a virtual machine




After installing all required VirtIO drivers to the virtual machine, the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk no longer needs to be attached to the virtual machine. Remove the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk from the virtual machine configuration file.

 **Procedure** 

1. Edit the configuration file and remove the `    disk` and the `    volume` .
    
    
    ```
    $ oc edit vm &lt;vm-name&gt;
    ```
    
    
    ```
    spec:      domain:        devices:          disks:            - name: virtiocontainerdisk              bootOrder: 2              cdrom:                bus: sata    volumes:      - containerDisk:          image: container-native-virtualization/virtio-win        name: virtiocontainerdisk
    ```
    
    
1. Reboot the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.
