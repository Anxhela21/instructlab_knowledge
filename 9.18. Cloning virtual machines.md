## 9.18. Cloning virtual machines




### 9.18.1. Enabling user permissions to clone data volumes across namespaces




The isolating nature of namespaces means that users cannot by default clone resources between namespaces.

To enable a user to clone a virtual machine to another namespace, a user with the `cluster-admin` role must create a new cluster role. Bind this cluster role to a user to enable them to clone virtual machines to the destination namespace.

#### 9.18.1.1. Prerequisites




- Only a user with the [cluster-admin](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/authentication_and_authorization/#default-roles_using-rbac) role can create cluster roles.


#### 9.18.1.2. About data volumes




 `DataVolume` objects are custom resources that are provided by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) project. Data volumes orchestrate import, clone, and upload operations that are associated with an underlying persistent volume claim (PVC). Data volumes are integrated with OpenShift Virtualization, and they prevent a virtual machine from being started before the PVC has been prepared.

#### 9.18.1.3. Creating RBAC resources for cloning data volumes




Create a new cluster role that enables permissions for all actions for the `datavolumes` resource.

 **Procedure** 

1. Create a `    ClusterRole` manifest:
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1    kind: ClusterRole    metadata:      name: &lt;datavolume-cloner&gt;<span id="CO51-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>rules:    - apiGroups: ["cdi.kubevirt.io"]      resources: ["datavolumes/source"]      verbs: ["*"]
    ```
    
    
1. Create the cluster role in the cluster:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc create -f &lt;datavolume-cloner.yaml&gt;<span id="CO52-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
    ```
    
    
1. Create a `    RoleBinding` manifest that applies to both the source and destination namespaces and references the cluster role created in the previous step.
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1    kind: RoleBinding    metadata:      name: &lt;allow-clone-to-user&gt;<span id="CO53-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>namespace: &lt;Source namespace&gt;<span id="CO53-2"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">2</span>subjects:    - kind: ServiceAccount      name: default      namespace: &lt;Destination namespace&gt;<span id="CO53-3"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">3</span>roleRef:      kind: ClusterRole      name: datavolume-cloner<span id="CO53-4"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">4</span>apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```
    
    
1. Create the role binding in the cluster:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc create -f &lt;datavolume-cloner.yaml&gt;<span id="CO54-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
    ```
    
    


### 9.18.2. Cloning a virtual machine disk into a new data volume




You can clone the persistent volume claim (PVC) of a virtual machine disk into a new data volume by referencing the source PVC in your data volume configuration file.

Warning
Cloning operations between different volume modes are supported, such as cloning from a persistent volume (PV) with `volumeMode: Block` to a PV with `volumeMode: Filesystem` .

However, you can only clone between different volume modes if they are of the `contentType: kubevirt` .



Tip
When you enable preallocation globally, or for a single data volume, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) preallocates disk space during cloning. Preallocation enhances write performance. For more information, see [Using preallocation for data volumes](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes) .



#### 9.18.2.1. Prerequisites




- Users need [additional permissions](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes) to clone the PVC of a virtual machine disk into another namespace.


#### 9.18.2.2. About data volumes




 `DataVolume` objects are custom resources that are provided by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) project. Data volumes orchestrate import, clone, and upload operations that are associated with an underlying persistent volume claim (PVC). Data volumes are integrated with OpenShift Virtualization, and they prevent a virtual machine from being started before the PVC has been prepared.

#### 9.18.2.3. Cloning the persistent volume claim of a virtual machine disk into a new data volume




You can clone a persistent volume claim (PVC) of an existing virtual machine disk into a new data volume. The new data volume can then be used for a new virtual machine.

Note
When a data volume is created independently of a virtual machine, the lifecycle of the data volume is independent of the virtual machine. If the virtual machine is deleted, neither the data volume nor its associated PVC is deleted.



 **Prerequisites** 

- Determine the PVC of an existing virtual machine disk to use. You must power down the virtual machine that is associated with the PVC before you can clone it.
- Install the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).


 **Procedure** 

1. Examine the virtual machine disk you want to clone to identify the name and namespace of the associated PVC.
1. Create a YAML file for a data volume that specifies the name of the new data volume, the name and namespace of the source PVC, and the size of the new data volume.
    
    For example:
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1    kind: DataVolume    metadata:      name: &lt;cloner-datavolume&gt;<span id="CO55-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>spec:      source:        pvc:          namespace: "&lt;source-namespace&gt;"<span id="CO55-2"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">2</span>name: "&lt;my-favorite-vm-disk&gt;"<span id="CO55-3"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">3</span>pvc:        accessModes:          - ReadWriteOnce        resources:          requests:            storage: &lt;2Gi&gt;<span id="CO55-4"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">4</span>
    ```
    
    
1. Start cloning the PVC by creating the data volume:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc create -f &lt;cloner-datavolume&gt;.yaml
    ```
    
    Note
    Data volumes prevent a virtual machine from starting before the PVC is prepared, so you can create a virtual machine that references the new data volume while the PVC clones.

### 9.18.3. Cloning a virtual machine by using a data volume template




You can create a new virtual machine by cloning the persistent volume claim (PVC) of an existing VM. By including a `dataVolumeTemplate` in your virtual machine configuration file, you create a new data volume from the original PVC.

Warning
Cloning operations between different volume modes are supported, such as cloning from a persistent volume (PV) with `volumeMode: Block` to a PV with `volumeMode: Filesystem` .

However, you can only clone between different volume modes if they are of the `contentType: kubevirt` .



Tip
When you enable preallocation globally, or for a single data volume, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) preallocates disk space during cloning. Preallocation enhances write performance. For more information, see [Using preallocation for data volumes](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes) .



#### 9.18.3.1. Prerequisites




- Users need [additional permissions](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes) to clone the PVC of a virtual machine disk into another namespace.


#### 9.18.3.2. About data volumes




 `DataVolume` objects are custom resources that are provided by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) project. Data volumes orchestrate import, clone, and upload operations that are associated with an underlying persistent volume claim (PVC). Data volumes are integrated with OpenShift Virtualization, and they prevent a virtual machine from being started before the PVC has been prepared.

#### 9.18.3.3. Creating a new virtual machine from a cloned persistent volume claim by using a data volume template




You can create a virtual machine that clones the persistent volume claim (PVC) of an existing virtual machine into a data volume. Reference a `dataVolumeTemplate` in the virtual machine manifest and the `source` PVC is cloned to a data volume, which is then automatically used for the creation of the virtual machine.

Note
When a data volume is created as part of the data volume template of a virtual machine, the lifecycle of the data volume is then dependent on the virtual machine. If the virtual machine is deleted, the data volume and associated PVC are also deleted.



 **Prerequisites** 

- Determine the PVC of an existing virtual machine disk to use. You must power down the virtual machine that is associated with the PVC before you can clone it.
- Install the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).


 **Procedure** 

1. Examine the virtual machine you want to clone to identify the name and namespace of the associated PVC.
1. Create a YAML file for a `    VirtualMachine` object. The following virtual machine example clones `    my-favorite-vm-disk` , which is located in the `    source-namespace` namespace. The `    2Gi` data volume called `    favorite-clone` is created from `    my-favorite-vm-disk` .
    
    For example:
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1    kind: VirtualMachine    metadata:      labels:        kubevirt.io/vm: vm-dv-clone      name: vm-dv-clone<span id="CO56-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>spec:      running: false      template:        metadata:          labels:            kubevirt.io/vm: vm-dv-clone        spec:          domain:            devices:              disks:              - disk:                  bus: virtio                name: root-disk            resources:              requests:                memory: 64M          volumes:          - dataVolume:              name: favorite-clone            name: root-disk      dataVolumeTemplates:      - metadata:          name: favorite-clone        spec:          storage:            accessModes:            - ReadWriteOnce            resources:              requests:                storage: 2Gi          source:            pvc:              namespace: "source-namespace"              name: "my-favorite-vm-disk"
    ```
    
    
1. Create the virtual machine with the PVC-cloned data volume:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc create -f &lt;vm-clone-datavolumetemplate&gt;.yaml
    ```

### 9.18.4. Cloning a virtual machine disk into a new block storage data volume




You can clone the persistent volume claim (PVC) of a virtual machine disk into a new block data volume by referencing the source PVC in your data volume configuration file.

Warning
Cloning operations between different volume modes are supported, such as cloning from a persistent volume (PV) with `volumeMode: Block` to a PV with `volumeMode: Filesystem` .

However, you can only clone between different volume modes if they are of the `contentType: kubevirt` .



Tip
When you enable preallocation globally, or for a single data volume, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) preallocates disk space during cloning. Preallocation enhances write performance. For more information, see [Using preallocation for data volumes](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes) .



#### 9.18.4.1. Prerequisites




- Users need [additional permissions](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes) to clone the PVC of a virtual machine disk into another namespace.


#### 9.18.4.2. About data volumes




 `DataVolume` objects are custom resources that are provided by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) project. Data volumes orchestrate import, clone, and upload operations that are associated with an underlying persistent volume claim (PVC). Data volumes are integrated with OpenShift Virtualization, and they prevent a virtual machine from being started before the PVC has been prepared.

#### 9.18.4.3. About block persistent volumes




A block persistent volume (PV) is a PV that is backed by a raw block device. These volumes do not have a file system and can provide performance benefits for virtual machines by reducing overhead.

Raw block volumes are provisioned by specifying `volumeMode: Block` in the PV and persistent volume claim (PVC) specification.

#### 9.18.4.4. Creating a local block persistent volume




Create a local block persistent volume (PV) on a node by populating a file and mounting it as a loop device. You can then reference this loop device in a PV manifest as a `Block` volume and use it as a block device for a virtual machine image.

 **Procedure** 

1. Log in as `    root` to the node on which to create the local PV. This procedure uses `    node01` for its examples.
1. Create a file and populate it with null characters so that it can be used as a block device. The following example creates a file `    loop10` with a size of 2Gb (20 100Mb blocks):
    
    
    ```
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=&lt;loop10&gt; bs=100M count=20
    ```
    
    
1. Mount the `    loop10` file as a loop device.
    
    
    ```
    $ losetup &lt;/dev/loop10&gt;d3 &lt;loop10&gt;<span id="CO57-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span><span id="CO57-2"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">2</span>
    ```
    
    
1. Create a `    PersistentVolume` manifest that references the mounted loop device.
    
    
    ```
    kind: PersistentVolume    apiVersion: v1    metadata:      name: &lt;local-block-pv10&gt;      annotations:    spec:      local:        path: &lt;/dev/loop10&gt;<span id="CO58-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>capacity:        storage: &lt;2Gi&gt;      volumeMode: Block<span id="CO58-2"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">2</span>storageClassName: local<span id="CO58-3"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">3</span>accessModes:        - ReadWriteOnce      persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete      nodeAffinity:        required:          nodeSelectorTerms:          - matchExpressions:            - key: kubernetes.io/hostname              operator: In              values:              - &lt;node01&gt;<span id="CO58-4"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">4</span>
    ```
    
    
1. Create the block PV.
    
    
    ```
    # oc create -f &lt;local-block-pv10.yaml&gt;<span id="CO59-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>
    ```
    
    


#### 9.18.4.5. Cloning the persistent volume claim of a virtual machine disk into a new data volume




You can clone a persistent volume claim (PVC) of an existing virtual machine disk into a new data volume. The new data volume can then be used for a new virtual machine.

Note
When a data volume is created independently of a virtual machine, the lifecycle of the data volume is independent of the virtual machine. If the virtual machine is deleted, neither the data volume nor its associated PVC is deleted.



 **Prerequisites** 

- Determine the PVC of an existing virtual machine disk to use. You must power down the virtual machine that is associated with the PVC before you can clone it.
- Install the OpenShift CLI ( `    oc` ).
- At least one available block persistent volume (PV) that is the same size as or larger than the source PVC.


 **Procedure** 

1. Examine the virtual machine disk you want to clone to identify the name and namespace of the associated PVC.
1. Create a YAML file for a data volume that specifies the name of the new data volume, the name and namespace of the source PVC, `    volumeMode: Block` so that an available block PV is used, and the size of the new data volume.
    
    For example:
    
    
    ```
    apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1    kind: DataVolume    metadata:      name: &lt;cloner-datavolume&gt;<span id="CO60-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>spec:      source:        pvc:          namespace: "&lt;source-namespace&gt;"<span id="CO60-2"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">2</span>name: "&lt;my-favorite-vm-disk&gt;"<span id="CO60-3"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">3</span>pvc:        accessModes:          - ReadWriteOnce        resources:          requests:            storage: &lt;2Gi&gt;<span id="CO60-4"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">4</span>volumeMode: Block<span id="CO60-5"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">5</span>
    ```
    
    
1. Start cloning the PVC by creating the data volume:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc create -f &lt;cloner-datavolume&gt;.yaml
    ```
    
    Note
    Data volumes prevent a virtual machine from starting before the PVC is prepared, so you can create a virtual machine that references the new data volume while the PVC clones.
