## 9.2.1. Customizing the storage profile

You can specify default parameters by editing the StorageProfile object for the provisioner's storage class. These default parameters only apply to the persistent volume claim (PVC) if they are not configured in the DataVolume object.

You cannot modify storage class parameters. To make changes, delete and re-create the storage class. You must then reapply any customizations that were previously made to the storage profile.

An empty status section in a storage profile indicates that a storage provisioner is not recognized by the Containerized Data Interface (CDI). Customizing a storage profile is necessary if you have a storage provisioner that is not recognized by CDI. In this case, the administrator sets appropriate values in the storage profile to ensure successful allocations.
