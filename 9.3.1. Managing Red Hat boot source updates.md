You can opt out of automatic updates for all system-defined boot sources by disabling the enableCommonBootImageImport feature gate. If you disable this feature gate, all DataImportCron objects are deleted. This does not remove previously imported boot source objects that store operating system images, though administrators can delete them manually.

When the enableCommonBootImageImport feature gate is disabled, DataSource objects are reset so that they no longer point to the original boot source. An administrator can manually provide a boot source by creating a new persistent volume claim (PVC) or volume snapshot for the DataSource object, then populating it with an operating system image.
