## 9.3.1.1. Managing automatic updates for all system-defined boot sources

Disabling automatic boot source imports and updates can lower resource usage. In disconnected environments, disabling automatic boot source updates prevents CDIDataImportCronOutdated alerts from filling up logs.

To disable automatic updates for all system-defined boot sources, turn off the enableCommonBootImageImport feature gate by setting the value to false . Setting this value to true re-enables the feature gate and turns automatic updates back on.
