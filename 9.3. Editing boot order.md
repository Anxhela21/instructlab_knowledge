## 9.3. Editing boot order




You can update the values for a boot order list by using the web console or the CLI.

With **Boot Order** in the **Virtual Machine Overview** page, you can:

- Select a disk or network interface controller (NIC) and add it to the boot order list.
- Edit the order of the disks or NICs in the boot order list.
- Remove a disk or NIC from the boot order list, and return it back to the inventory of bootable sources.


### 9.3.1. Adding items to a boot order list in the web console




Add items to a boot order list by using the web console.

 **Procedure** 

1. Click **Virtualization** → **VirtualMachines** from the side menu.
1. Select a virtual machine to open the **VirtualMachine details** page.
1. Click the **Details** tab.
1. Click the pencil icon that is located on the right side of **Boot Order** . If a YAML configuration does not exist, or if this is the first time that you are creating a boot order list, the following message displays: **No resource selected. VM will attempt to boot from disks by order of appearance in YAML file.** 
1. Click **Add Source** and select a bootable disk or network interface controller (NIC) for the virtual machine.
1. Add any additional disks or NICs to the boot order list.

### 9.3.3. Editing a boot order list in the YAML configuration file




Edit the boot order list in a YAML configuration file by using the CLI.

 **Procedure** 

1. Open the YAML configuration file for the virtual machine by running the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc edit vm example
    ```
    
    
1. Edit the YAML file and modify the values for the boot order associated with a disk or network interface controller (NIC). For example:
    
    
    ```
    disks:      - bootOrder: 1<span id="CO11-1"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">1</span>disk:          bus: virtio        name: containerdisk      - disk:          bus: virtio        name: cloudinitdisk      - cdrom:          bus: virtio        name: cd-drive-1    interfaces:      - boot Order: 2<span id="CO11-2"><!--Empty--></span><span class="callout">2</span>macAddress: '02:96:c4:00:00'        masquerade: {}        name: default
    ```
    
    
1. Save the YAML file.
1. Click **reload the content** to apply the updated boot order values from the YAML file to the boot order list in the web console.


### 9.3.4. Removing items from a boot order list in the web console




Remove items from a boot order list by using the web console.

 **Procedure** 

1. Click **Virtualization** → **VirtualMachines** from the side menu.
1. Select a virtual machine to open the **VirtualMachine details** page.
1. Click the **Details** tab.
1. Click the pencil icon that is located on the right side of **Boot Order** .
1. Click the **Remove** icon![delete](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.11-Virtualization-en-US/images/0c9dfaee3baa4ec510d2408d7c523559/delete.png)
    next to the item. The item is removed from the boot order list and saved in the list of available boot sources. If you remove all items from the boot order list, the following message displays: **No resource selected. VM will attempt to boot from disks by order of appearance in YAML file.**
