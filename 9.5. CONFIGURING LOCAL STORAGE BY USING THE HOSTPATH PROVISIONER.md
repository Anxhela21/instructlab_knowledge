## 9.5. CONFIGURING LOCAL STORAGE BY USING THE HOSTPATH PROVISIONER

You can configure local storage for virtual machines by using the hostpath provisioner (HPP).

When you install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator, the Hostpath Provisioner Operator is automatically installed. HPP is a local storage provisioner designed for OpenShift Virtualization that is created by the Hostpath Provisioner Operator. To use HPP, you create an HPP custom resource (CR) with a basic storage pool.
