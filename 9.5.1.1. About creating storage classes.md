## 9.5.1.1. About creating storage classes

When you create a storage class, you set parameters that affect the dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes (PVs) that belong to that storage class. You cannot update a StorageClass object's parameters after you create it.

In order to use the hostpath provisioner (HPP) you must create an associated storage class for the CSI driver with the storagePools stanza.
