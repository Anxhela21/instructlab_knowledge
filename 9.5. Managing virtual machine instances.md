## 9.5. Managing virtual machine instances




If you have standalone virtual machine instances (VMIs) that were created independently outside of the OpenShift Virtualization environment, you can manage them by using the web console or by using `oc` or [virtctl](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-using-the-cli-tools) commands from the command-line interface (CLI).

The `virtctl` command provides more virtualization options than the `oc` command. For example, you can use `virtctl` to pause a VM or expose a port.

### 9.5.1. About virtual machine instances




A virtual machine instance (VMI) is a representation of a running virtual machine (VM). When a VMI is owned by a VM or by another object, you manage it through its owner in the web console or by using the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).

A standalone VMI is created and started independently with a script, through automation, or by using other methods in the CLI. In your environment, you might have standalone VMIs that were developed and started outside of the OpenShift Virtualization environment. You can continue to manage those standalone VMIs by using the CLI. You can also use the web console for specific tasks associated with standalone VMIs:

- List standalone VMIs and their details.
- Edit labels and annotations for a standalone VMI.
- Delete a standalone VMI.


When you delete a VM, the associated VMI is automatically deleted. You delete a standalone VMI directly because it is not owned by VMs or other objects.

Note
Before you uninstall OpenShift Virtualization, list and view the standalone VMIs by using the CLI or the web console. Then, delete any outstanding VMIs.



### 9.5.2. Listing all virtual machine instances using the CLI




You can list all virtual machine instances (VMIs) in your cluster, including standalone VMIs and those owned by virtual machines, by using the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).

 **Procedure** 

- List all VMIs by running the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc get vmis -A
    ```
    
    


### 9.5.3. Listing standalone virtual machine instances using the web console




Using the web console, you can list and view standalone virtual machine instances (VMIs) in your cluster that are not owned by virtual machines (VMs).

Note
VMIs that are owned by VMs or other objects are not displayed in the web console. The web console displays only standalone VMIs. If you want to list all VMIs in your cluster, you must use the CLI.



 **Procedure** 

- Click **Virtualization** → **VirtualMachines** from the side menu.
    
    You can identify a standalone VMI by a dark colored badge next to its name.
    
    


### 9.5.4. Editing a standalone virtual machine instance using the web console




You can edit the annotations and labels of a standalone virtual machine instance (VMI) using the web console. Other fields are not editable.

 **Procedure** 

1. In the OpenShift Container Platform console, click **Virtualization** → **VirtualMachines** from the side menu.
1. Select a standalone VMI to open the **VirtualMachineInstance details** page.
1. On the **Details** tab, click the pencil icon beside **Annotations** or **Labels** .
1. Make the relevant changes and click **Save** .


### 9.5.5. Deleting a standalone virtual machine instance using the CLI




You can delete a standalone virtual machine instance (VMI) by using the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).

 **Prerequisites** 

- Identify the name of the VMI that you want to delete.


 **Procedure** 

- Delete the VMI by running the following command:
    
    
    ```
    $ oc delete vmi &lt;vmi_name&gt;
    ```
    
    


### 9.5.6. Deleting a standalone virtual machine instance using the web console




Delete a standalone virtual machine instance (VMI) from the web console.

 **Procedure** 

1. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click **Virtualization** → **VirtualMachines** from the side menu.
1. Click **Actions** → **Delete VirtualMachineInstance** .
1. In the confirmation pop-up window, click **Delete** to permanently delete the standalone VMI.
