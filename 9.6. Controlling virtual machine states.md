## 9.6. Controlling virtual machine states




You can stop, start, restart, and unpause virtual machines from the web console.

You can use [virtctl](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-using-the-cli-tools) to manage virtual machine states and perform other actions from the CLI. For example, you can use `virtctl` to force stop a VM or expose a port.
