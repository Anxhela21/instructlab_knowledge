## 9.7.1. About CPU and memory quotas in a namespace

A resource quota , defined by the ResourceQuota object, imposes restrictions on a namespace that limit the total amount of compute resources that can be consumed by resources within that namespace.

The HyperConverged custom resource (CR) defines the user configuration for the Containerized Data Importer (CDI). The CPU and memory request and limit values are set to a default value of 0 . This ensures that pods created by CDI that do not specify compute resource requirements are given the default values and are allowed to run in a namespace that is restricted with a quota.

When the AutoResourceLimits feature gate is enabled, OpenShift Virtualization automatically

When the AutoResourceLimits feature gate is enabled, OpenShift Virtualization automatically manages CPU and memory limits. If a namespace has both CPU and memory quotas, the memory limit is set to double the base allocation and the CPU limit is one per vCPU.
