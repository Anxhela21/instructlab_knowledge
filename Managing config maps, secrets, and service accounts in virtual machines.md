## 9.12.Â Managing config maps, secrets, and service accounts in virtual machines




You can use secrets, config maps, and service accounts to pass configuration data to virtual machines. For example, you can:

- Give a virtual machine access to a service that requires credentials by adding a secret to the virtual machine.
- Store non-confidential configuration data in a config map so that a pod or another object can consume the data.
- Allow a component to access the API server by associating a service account with that component.


Note
OpenShift Virtualization exposes secrets, config maps, and service accounts as virtual machine disks so that you can use them across platforms without additional overhead.
