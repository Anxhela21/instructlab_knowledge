## 9.5.Â Managing virtual machine instances




If you have standalone virtual machine instances (VMIs) that were created independently outside of the OpenShift Virtualization environment, you can manage them by using the web console or by using `oc` or [virtctl](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-using-the-cli-tools) commands from the command-line interface (CLI).

The `virtctl` command provides more virtualization options than the `oc` command. For example, you can use `virtctl` to pause a VM or expose a port.
