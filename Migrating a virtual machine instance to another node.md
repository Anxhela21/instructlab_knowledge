## 11.3.Â Migrating a virtual machine instance to another node




Manually initiate a live migration of a virtual machine instance to another node using either the web console or the CLI.

Note
If a virtual machine uses a host model CPU, you can perform live migration of that virtual machine only between nodes that support its host CPU model.
