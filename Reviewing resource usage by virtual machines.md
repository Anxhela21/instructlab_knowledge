## 13.8.Â Reviewing resource usage by virtual machines




Dashboards in the OpenShift Container Platform web console provide visual representations of cluster metrics to help you to quickly understand the state of your cluster. Dashboards belong to the [Monitoring overview](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/monitoring/#monitoring-overview) that provides monitoring for core platform components.

The OpenShift Virtualization dashboard provides data on resource consumption for virtual machines and associated pods. The visualization metrics displayed in the OpenShift Virtualization dashboard are based on [Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/virtualization/#virt-prometheus-queries) .

A [monitoring role](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/monitoring/#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects) is required to monitor user-defined namespaces in the OpenShift Virtualization dashboard.
