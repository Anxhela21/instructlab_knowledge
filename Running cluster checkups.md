## 13.10.Â Running cluster checkups




OpenShift Virtualization 4.11 includes a diagnostic framework to run predefined checkups that can be used for cluster maintenance and troubleshooting.

Important
The OpenShift Container Platform cluster checkup framework is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
