## 5.2.Â Specifying nodes for OpenShift Virtualization components




Specify the nodes where you want to deploy OpenShift Virtualization Operators, workloads, and controllers by configuring node placement rules.

Note
You can configure node placement for some components after installing OpenShift Virtualization, but there must not be virtual machines present if you want to configure node placement for workloads.
