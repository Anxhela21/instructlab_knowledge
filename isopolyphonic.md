Iso-Polyphony is a traditional part of Albanian folk music and is included in UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List. Albanian Iso-Polyphony is considered to have its roots in the many-voiced vajtim, the southern Albanian traditional lamentation of the dead. The instrumental expression of Albanian Iso-Polyphony evolved into the Albanian kaba.

All four regions of southern Albania—Lalëria (Myzeqe), Toskëria, Çamëria, and Labëria—incorporate polyphonic song into their culture. A related form of polyphonic singing is found in northern Albania, particularly in the areas of Peshkopi, Polog, Tetovo, Kičevo, and Gostivar in North Macedonia, as well as in Malësia in northern Albania and southern Montenegro.

Labëria is particularly well known for multipart singing, with songs featuring two, three, or four parts. Two-part songs are sung only by women, three-part songs can be performed by both men and women, and four-part songs are a specialty of Labëria. Research has shown that four-part songs developed after three-part ones and represent the most complex form of polyphonic singing.

The Gjirokastër National Folklore Festival in Albania has been held every five years in October since 1968 and typically includes many polyphonic songs.

Geographic Distribution

Albanian polyphonic traditional music is performed in two dialects of the Albanian language: Tosk and Lab. The Tosk musical dialect encompasses the ethnographic regions of Toskëria, Myzeqeja, and Chamëria, while the Lab musical dialect is specific to Labëria.

Origin

Albanian Iso-Polyphony is believed to originate from the many-voiced vajtim, the southern Albanian traditional lamentation of the dead. Scholars studying Albanian iso-polyphony and Balkan polyphonic music generally consider it an ancient tradition dating back to the Thraco-Illyrian era. Although historical documentation is scarce, the tradition has been preserved through oral transmission across generations. Specific features such as the pentatonic modal structure, recitative vocals, calls and shouts, and a cappella singing suggest an ancient origin.

Despite the region being under Byzantine rule for centuries, Balkan polyphonic traditional music developed differently from medieval Byzantine music. The Balkan tradition remained non-institutionalized and collectively formed, while Byzantine music was created by individual composers and institutionalized. Although the two traditions coexisted and likely influenced each other, the interaction between Albanian polyphonic traditional music and Byzantine music is considered relatively minor.

Evolution

Albanian polyphonic traditional music is thought to have initially consisted of two melodic lines: the taker (first voice) and the turner (second voice). The turner likely played a non-specific melodic role, a style still found in the two-voiced polyphonic singing of women in Gjirokastër. Over time, the turner became more precisely defined melodically, a tradition now seen among the men of Dukat. Two-voice iso-polyphony is also present in various regions of Albania, including Korcë, Librazhd, Pogradec, Kolonjë, Fier, Shpat i Sipërm of Elbasan, Myzeqe, Vlorë, Berat, Mallakastër, Gjirokastër, Lunxhëri, as well as in Albanian-speaking areas of Zajas, Kičevo, and Tetovo. Additionally, it is found among the Arbëreshë of Calabria. Scholar Vasil Tole argues that two-voice polyphony should not be seen merely as an initial stage but rather as a "hidden" form of three-voice polyphony.

The next development in Albanian traditional polyphony was the introduction of the drone (iso), which complemented the existing melodic lines and led to three-voiced polyphony. This addition enriched the harmonic interplay between melodic lines and became a common feature in modern Albanian polyphonic tradition. While traditionally sung only by men, three-voice iso-polyphony is now performed by mixed-gender groups in regions such as Skrapar, Gramsh, Devoll, Gjirokastër, Kolonjë, Sarandë, and Vlorë.

The final melodic line to develop was the launcher (hedhësi), creating four-voiced polyphony. This addition marked increased artistic sophistication without fundamentally altering vocal harmony and interplay. Four-voiced polyphony is exclusive to Labëria and coexists with the more common three-voiced style there. The consolidation of the four-voice method is attributed to Neço Muko through his recordings in the 1920s and 1930s. The instrumental expression of Albanian Iso-Polyphony eventually evolved into the Albanian kaba.

Pleqërishte

Pleqërishte is a genre of Albanian folk iso-polyphony sung by men in Labëria, primarily associated with the city of Gjirokastër and its surrounding areas. This genre is characterized by a slow tempo, low pitch, and limited vocal range. The term "pleqërishte" translates to both "of old men" and "of the old time," reflecting the singing style and lyrical themes of some of its songs. In Gjirokastër, pleqërishte songs are also referred to as "lashtërishte," meaning "of the ancient time." Although these specific themes have largely fallen out of common use, they remain thematically significant.

Pleqërishte songs maintain a slow tempo and low pitch with minimal vocal variation, distinguishing them from genres like "djemurishte" ("of young men"). As a four-part genre, pleqërishte features a third soloist (hedhës). In most four-part genres, the hedhës serves as a secondary drone a minor third above the keynote. However, in pleqërishte, the hedhës provides a break for the first soloist (marrës) by taking over temporarily. Each performance begins with the marrës singing the initial lines, followed by the introduction of the second soloist (kthyes) and then the hedhës. After the hedhës, the marrës's lyrics are repeated by the drone group in various forms.

Pleqërishte songs are showcased by the folk group "Pleqtë e Gjirokastrës," often regarded as the last representative of the genre. One of their most renowned songs is "Doli shkurti, hyri marsi," which narrates a battle between Çerçiz Topulli and Ottoman troops in 1908 in the village of Mashkullorë near Gjirokastër.
